# ResearchHunt

#### This project creates a search engine (based on keywords) useful for a digital library, results of which is automatically mailed to the student at regular intervals of three months. Having various functions like adding students, adding admins, maintaining a history/log for each student, searching for keywords, editting the keywords, sending mails, etc, this website is dynamic and user friendly. On the backend, I have a strong model combining WordNet similarity and word2vec which has the capacity to give highly accurate answers in a pretty low time.
