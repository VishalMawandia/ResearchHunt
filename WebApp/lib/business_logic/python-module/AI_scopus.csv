FR under surveillance scenario does not give satisfactory performance due to low contrast, noise and poor illumination conditions on probes, as compared to the training samples. A state-of-the-art technology, Deep Learning, even fails to perform well in these scenarios. We propose a novel soft-margin based learning method for multiple feature-kernel combinations, followed by feature transformed using Domain Adaptation, which outperforms many recent state-of-the-art techniques, when tested using three real-world surveillance face datasets. © 2016 IEEE.",,Biometrics; Computer vision; Monitoring; Pattern recognition; Biometric traits; Deep learning; Domain adaptation; Illumination conditions; Learning methods; Multiple features; State-of-the-art technology; Training sample; Face recognition,,,IEEE Computer Society,21607508,9781467388504,,,English,IEEE Comput.

The resulting distortions make it hard to discriminate between true moving objects and turbulence induced motion. Current algorithms are not effective in detecting true moving objects in the scene and also rely on computationally complex warping methods. In this paper, we describe a real time embedded solution connected with traditional cameras to both rectify turbulence distortions and reliably detect and track true moving targets. Our comparisons with other methods shows better turbulence rectification with less false and miss detections. FPGADSP based embedded realization of our algorithm achieves nearly 15x speed-up along with lesser memory requirement over a quad core PC implementation.

Screening at early stages using the popular Pap smear test has been demonstrated to reduce fatalities significantly. Cost effective, automated screening methods can significantly improve the adoption of these tests worldwide. Automated screening involves image analysis of cervical cells. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are widely used in image processing for segmentation which is a crucial step in image analysis. In our proposed method, GMM is implemented to segment cell regions to identify cellular features such as nucleus, cytoplasm while addressing shortcomings of existing methods. This method is combined with shape based identification of nucleus to increase the accuracy of nucleus segmentation. This enables the algorithm to accurately trace the cells and nucleus contours from the pap smear images that contain cell clusters. The method also accounts for inconsistent staining, if any.

Matching data from two different modalities, known as cross-modal matching is another challenging problem due to the large variations in the data coming from different modalities. Often, these are treated as two independent problems. But for applications like matching RGBD data, when only one modality is available during testing, it can reduce to either of the two problems. In this work, we propose a framework which can handle both these scenarios seamlessly with applications to matching RGBD data of Lambertian objects. The proposed approach jointly uses the RGB and depth data to learn an illumination invariant canonical version of the objects. Dictionaries are learnt for the RGB, depth and the canonical data, such that the transformed sparse coefficients of the RGB and the depth data is equal to that of the canonical data. Given RGB or depth data, their sparse coefficients corresponding to their canonical version is computed which can be directly used for matching using a Mahalanobis metric.

But, the performance of the descriptors, and their classifiers is affected negatively by this, due to the loss of important gradients along with the noisy ones. In this work, we show that the ranks of gradient magnitudes stay resilient to such a smoothing. We show that a combination of image smoothing and the ranks of gradient magnitudes yields good detection performances, especially when the variations in a dataset are large or the number of training samples is less.

Gender classification using texture features of faces exhibited promising improvement over other facial features. Gender classification finds applications in systems which use gender as one of the parameters. Local Binary Patterns (LBP) are known to have good texture representation properties. Through this paper we present a variant of Local Binary Patterns for gender classification which can discriminate the facial textures efficiently. In this method, we used a new neighborhood shape for obtaining LBP as its representation of texture is superior than traditional LBP. We compute the proposed LBP on each non-overlapping blocks of a face image and a histogram of these LBPs is computed. We used these histograms as facial feature vectors for gender classification as these histograms shown their robustness to compression and uniform intensity variations. The classification task has been achieved by using Support Vector Machine (SVM). We compared our method with existing gender classification methods based on LBP with classifier being the same as SVM.

The mobile nodes are free to move randomly and to arrange themselves in a random manner. Thus, the wireless ad hoc network topology may expand rapidly and unpredictably. In Mobile ad hoc networks, the routing protocol plays an important role for improving Quality of Service (QoS). There are many different types of routing protocols such as reactive, proactive, and hybrid. In reactive routing protocol, AODV is a one which establishes routes on-demand, as they are needed. In this paper, we proposed a new routing protocol called Reverse Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (R-AODV) routing which reduces route path fail correction messages and gives better performance than the original AODV routing protocol with respect to set of performance metric such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, energy consumption, and overhead under different pause time. We designed the R-AODV routing protocol and implemented with certain simulation parameters using Network Simulator (NS-2) tool. The performance analysis of routing protocol designed for wireless networks has been very challenging. Hence, simulations are always utilized to obtain the desired performance results. © 2015 IEEE.",AODV; MANETs; NS-2.; QoS; R-AODV,Ad hoc networks; Artificial intelligence; Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Routers; Routing protocols; Topology; Wireless ad hoc networks; AODV; AODV routing protocol; MANETs; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Packet delivery ratio; R-AODV; Reactive routing protocol; Reverse Ad Hoc on-demand distance vectors; Mobile ad hoc networks,"Biradar, S.; Dept. of Electronic and Communication Engineering, Don Bosco Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: siddubiradarr@gmail.com",Hijazi M.H.A.Saad I.Al-Dabass D.Bolong N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781467386753,,,English,"Proc. - AIMS, Int.

Local binary patterns are known for their robust texture describing capabilities and digital watermarking used in proving the ownership of a multimedia content. In this work we propose a LBP synthesis or inverse LBP matching process and its applicability to digital image watermarking. LBP synthesis process changes the neighborhood pixels values, so that the LBP computed from these pixels is the value we want to synthesize. This process takes into account the requirements of a digital image watermarking such as imperceptibility and robustness to watermark removal attacks. Because of the nature of LBP synthesis it is required that only few pixels of a given block are modified to embed watermark. The simulation results show that the method is robust to JPEG compression, rotation and scaling attacks. This LBP synthesis process could also be used to watermark sensor data for proving the ownership.

Digital watermarking helps in protecting the copyrights while reduces the monetary loss to the content owner. Digital watermarking is the process of inserting owner or customer related unique information as a watermark into a host signal such as audio or speech or image or video without disturbing perceived quality of the host signal. One of the main characteristic of a digital watermarking is to enable accurate watermark detection even if the multimedia content undergoes some changes that may eliminate the watermark from the content. These changes include compression, rate conversion, filtering and noise addition etc. In this paper, we present a watermarking method that can be used for watermarking both audio and speech. Watermark embedding is done using singular values obtained by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the structured Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficients, correlation peak to side-lobe ratio (PSLR) metric is used to detect watermark from the correlation output, which is computed between the singular values obtained from the watermarked content and each watermark in the database. This method has been implemented in MATLAB and tested on various audio and speech tracks against various signal processing modifications. The experimental results prove the robustness of proposed method while satisfying the imperceptibility criteria. © 2015 IEEE.",audio watermarking; compression; correlation; discrete wavelet transform; singular value decomposition; speech watermark,Artificial intelligence; Audio acoustics; Audio signal processing; Compaction; Copyrights; Correlation methods; Digital watermarking; Discrete wavelet transforms; MATLAB; Signal processing; Singular value decomposition; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Copyright protections; Correlation peaks; Multimedia contents; Perceived quality; Singular values; Watermark detection; Watermark embedding; Watermarking methods; Audio watermarking,"Kakkirala, K.R.; TCS Innovation LabsIndia; email: krishna.kakkirala@tcs.com",Hijazi M.H.A.Saad I.Al-Dabass D.Bolong N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781467386753,,,English,"Proc. - AIMS, Int.

These tiny sensor nodes are operated by battery power and the battery operated sensor node cannot be recharged or replaced very easily. So, minimization of energy consumption to prolong the network life is an important issue. To resolve this issue, sensor nodes are sometimes combined to form a group and each group is known as a cluster. In each cluster, a leader node is elected which is called as the cluster head (CH). When any event is detected, each node senses the environment and sends to the respective cluster heads. Then cluster heads send the information to the base station (BS). So, appropriate cluster head election can reduce considerable amount of energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a cluster head election algorithm using Type-2 Fuzzy Logic, by considering some fuzzy descriptors such as remaining battery power, distance to base station, and concentration, which is expected to minimize energy consumption and extends the network lifetime. © 2015 IEEE.",Fuzzy Logic Type-2; Mamdanis Method; WSN,Artificial intelligence; Base stations; Clustering algorithms; Computer circuits; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Electric batteries; Energy utilization; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Border protection; Cluster-head elections; Disaster management; Mamdanis Method; Remaining battery power; Security surveillance; Type-2 fuzzy logic; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Fuzzy logic,"Pushpalatha, D.V.; Dept. of EEE, GRIETIndia; email: dvplatha@gmail.com",Hijazi M.H.A.Saad I.Al-Dabass D.Bolong N.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781467386753,,,English,"Proc. - AIMS, Int.

But, these are restricted by the interference in the system. The Co-Channel Interference(CCI) is one of the major sources of interference which exists mainly due to the concept of frequency reuse. The effect of CCI is more in CDMA based systems because the frequency reuse ratio is unity in those systems. In this paper, a new method is proposed to approximate capacity and coverage of a 3G WCDMA under the impact of CCI. The effect of CCI is described in terms of CCI probability. The conditional probability of CCI is analyzed under Rayleigh distributed signals. In this, COST 231 Hata model is described to calculate coverage area. The capacity and coverage are evaluated in terms of different number of Co-Channel interferers, antenna gain ratio, voice activity factor, Eb/No and with various data rates. It is shown that capacity increases with less number of active Co-Channel interferers and with low data rates. The cellular coverage area of WCDMA is improved by increasing the base station antenna height. The scheme proposed in this paper can also be successfully applied to evaluate capacity and coverage in 3GPP LTE and LTE Advanced systems. © 2016 IEEE.",CCI Probability; Co-Channel Interference(CCI); COST 231 Hata model; LTE; LTE Advanced; WCDMA,4G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Artificial intelligence; Cellular telephone systems; Code division multiple access; Image resolution; Interference suppression; Mobile telecommunication systems; Pattern recognition; Probability; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Approximate capacities; Co-channel interference mitigations; Cochannel interference (CCI); Conditional probabilities; Hata model; Lte- advanced; Voice activity factors; WCDMA; Cochannel interference,"Madhu, R.; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, University College of Engineering Kakinada (Autonomous), JNTUKIndia; email: madhu_ramarkula@jntucek.ac.in",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781467391870,,,English,"Int.

The proposed kernel is computed between the pair of examples, represented as sets of local feature vectors, by matching the estimates of example-specific densities computed at every local feature vector in those two examples. In this work, the number of local feature vectors of an example among the K nearest neighbors of a local feature vector is considered as an estimate of the example-specific density. The minimum of the two example-specific densities, one for each example, at a local feature vector is considered as the matching score. The ESDMK is then computed as the sum of the matching score computed at every local feature vector in a pair of examples. We also propose the spatial ESDMK (SESDMK) to include spatial information present in the scene images while matching the pair of scene images. Each of the scene images is divided spatially into a fixed number of regions. Then the SESDMK is computed as a combination of region specific ESDMKs that match the corresponding regions. We study the performance of the support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers using the proposed ESDMKs for scene classification and compare with that of the SVM-based classifiers using the state-of-the-art kernels for sets of local feature vectors. © 2015 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Density (specific gravity); Face recognition; Image retrieval; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Vectors; Fixed numbers; K-nearest neighbors; Local feature vectors; Matching score; Scene classification; Spatial informations; State of the art; SVM-based classifiers; Image matching,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781509002870,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The term 'group dynamics' was originally coined by social psychologist Kurt Lewin to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people. Its study is useful today in a wide variety of applications such as gaining a better understanding of decision making behavior or evaluating the health of workplace environments. Metrics need to be defined to measure the quality of relations in a group by performing an analysis on each individual member of the group. Previous research in the field performs this through the means of surveying (generally through questionnaires) each member of the group.

A challenging issue with GCM output for local relevance is their coarse spatial resolution of the projected variables. Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) identifies relationships between large-scale predictors (i.e., GCM-based) and local-scale predictands using multiple linear regression models. In this study (SDSM) was applied to downscale rainfall and temperature from GCMs. The data from single station located in the Indira Sagar canal command area at Madhya Pradesh, India were used as input of the SDSM. The study included calibration and validation with large-scale atmospheric variables encompassing the NCEP reanalysis data, the future estimation due to a climate scenario, which is HadCM3 A2. Results of the downscaling experiment demonstrate that during the calibration and validation stages, the SDSM model can be well acceptable regard its performance in the downscaling of daily rainfall and temperature. For a future period (2010-2099), the SDSM model estimated an increase in total average annual rainfall and annual average temperature for station. This indicates that the area of station considered will be wet and humid in the future. Also, the mean temperature is projected to rise to 1.5 C to 2.5 C for present study area. However, the model projections show a rise in mean daily precipitation with varying percentage in the months of July (0.59% to 2.09%) and August (0.79% to 1.19) under A2 of HadCM3 model for future periods. © 2015 IEEE.",Canal command; GCM data; Scenario generation; SDSM; Statistical downscaling,Artificial intelligence; Calibration; Climate models; Hydraulic structures; Learning systems; Linear regression; Rain; Regression analysis; Calibration and validations; GCM data; General circulation model; Multiple linear regression models; Scenario generation; SDSM; Statistical downscaling; Statistical downscaling model (SDSM); Climate change,"Deo, R.; School of Agricultural, Computational and Environmental, University of SouthernAustralia; email: ravinesh.deo@usq.edu.au",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781509002870,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

We extend the notion of classification calibration, which has been studied for binary and multiclass 0-1 classification problems (and for certain other specific learning problems), to the general multiclass setting, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a surrogate loss to be calibrated with respect to a loss matrix in this setting. We then introduce the notion of convex calibration dimension of a multiclass loss matrix, which measures the smallest 'size' of a prediction space in which it is possible to design a convex surrogate that is calibrated with respect to the loss matrix. We derive both upper and lower bounds on this quantity, and use these results to analyze various loss matrices. In particular, we apply our framework to study various subset ranking losses, and use the convex calibration dimension as a tool to show both the existence and non-existence of various types of convex calibrated surrogates for these losses. Our results strengthen recent results of Duchi et al. (2010) and Calauzènes et al. (2012) on the non-existence of certain types of convex calibrated surrogates in subset ranking.

These games capture the idea of coordination in the absence of globally common strategies. Prior work shows that the problem of determining the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium for these games is NP-complete already for graphs with all weights equal to one and no bonuses. However, for several classes of graphs (e.g. DAGs and cliques) pure Nash equilibria or even strong equilibria always exist and can be found by simply following a particular improvement or coalition-improvement path, respectively. In this paper we identify several natural classes of graphs for which a finite improvement or coalition-improvement path of polynomial length always exists, and, as a consequence, a Nash equilibrium or strong equilibrium in them can be found in polynomial time. We also argue that these results are optimal in the sense that in natural generalisations of these classes of graphs, a pure Nash equilibrium may not even exist.",,Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Congestion control (communication); Directed graphs; Game theory; Graphic methods; Local search (optimization); Polynomial approximation; Common strategy; Games on graphs; Nash equilibria; Polynomial length; Polynomial-time; Pure Nash equilibrium; Strong equilibrium; Weighted directed graph; Graph theory,,Kambhampati S.,International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

Thus, developing algorithms that adapt across domains by leveraging data from multiple domains is critical. However, existing adaptation algorithms often fail to identify the right sources to use for adaptation. In this work, we present a novel multi-source iterative domain adaptation algorithm (MSIDA) that leverages knowledge from selective sources to improve the performance in a target domain. The algorithm first chooses the best K sources from possibly numerous existing domains taking into account both similarity and complementarity properties of the domains. Then it learns target specific features in an iterative manner building on the common shared representations from the source domains. We give theoretical justifications for our source selection procedure and also give mistake bounds for the MSIDA algorithm. Experimental results justify the theory as MSIDA significantly outperforms existing cross-domain classification approaches on the real world and benchmark datasets.",,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Adaptation algorithms; Benchmark datasets; Classification approach; Domain adaptation; Multiple domains; Shared representations; Source selection; User-generated content; Iterative methods,,Kambhampati S.,International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

An increasingly popular approach for automatically inferring the details of a video is to associate the spatiotemporal segments in a video with its natural language descriptions. Most algorithms for connecting natural language with video rely on pre-aligned supervised training data. Recently, several models have been shown to be effective for unsupervised alignment of objects in video with language. However, it remains difficult to generate good spatiotemporal video segments for actions that align well with language. This paper presents a framework that extracts higher level representations of lowlevel action features through hyperfeature coding from video and aligns them with language. We propose a two-step process that creates a high level action feature codebook with temporally consistent motions, and then applies an unsupervised alignment algorithm over the action code words and verbs in the language to identify individual activities. We show an improvement over previous alignment models of objects and nouns on videos of biological experiments, and also evaluate our system on a larger scale collection of videos involving kitchen activities.",,Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Alignment algorithms; Biological experiments; Complex activity; Feature codebook; Natural languages; Supervised trainings; Two-step process; Video technologies; High level languages,,Kambhampati S.,International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

However, most studies have focused on the complete information setting, wherein the manipulators know the votes of the non-manipulators. While this assumption is reasonable for purposes of showing intractability, it is unrealistic for algorithmic considerations. In most real-world scenarios, it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate knowledge of all the other votes. In this paper, we investigate manipulation with incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators know a partial order for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter. In this setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of manipulation, namely weak, opportunistic, and strong manipulation. We consider several scenarios for which the traditional manipulation problems are easy (for instance, Borda with a single manipulator). For many of them, the corresponding manipulative questions that we propose turn out to be computationally intractable. Our hardness results often hold even when very little information is missing, or in other words, even when the instances are quite close to the complete information setting. Our overall conclusion is that computational hardness continues to be a valid obstruction to manipulation, in the context of a more realistic model.",,Artificial intelligence; Coalitional manipulations; Complete information; Computational hardness; Hardness result; Incomplete information; Partial information; Real-world scenario; Realistic model; Manipulators,,Kambhampati S.,International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

Overstaying of an EV after a charging event is a key contributor to low utilization. Since overstaying is easily detectable by monitoring the power drawn from the charger, managing this problem primarily involves designing an appropriate ""penalty"" during the overstaying period. Higher penalties do discourage overstaying; however, due to uncertainty in parking duration, less people would find such penalties acceptable, leading to decreased utilization (and revenue). To analyze this central tradeoff, we develop a novel framework that integrates models for realistic user behavior into queueing dynamics to locate the optimal penalty from the points of view of utilization and revenue, for different values of the external charging demand. Next, when the model parameters are unknown, we show how an online learning algorithm, such as UCB, can be adapted to learn the optimal penalty. Our experimental validation, based on charging data from London, shows that an appropriate penalty can increase both utilization and revenue while significantly reducing overstaying.",,Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Charging demands; Charging infrastructures; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Experimental validations; Model parameters; Online learning algorithms; Optimal penalty; Service provider; Electric vehicles,,Kambhampati S.,International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

We extend this line of research and study preference elicitation for single peaked preferences on trees which is a strict superset of the domain of single peaked preferences.

Two states that are not globally symmetric, can be contextually symmetric under some specific assignment to a subset of variables, referred to as the context variables. Contextual symmetry subsumes previous symmetry definitions and can represent a large class of symmetries not representable earlier.

Starting with an arbitrary initial policy, PI repeatedly updates to a dominating policy until an optimal policy is found. The update step involves switching the actions corresponding to a set of ""improvable"" states, which are easily identified. Whereas progress is guaranteed even if just one improvable state is switched at every step, the canonical variant of PI, attributed to Howard [1960], switches every improvable state in order to obtain the next iterate. For MDPs with n states and 2 actions per state, the tightest known bound on the complexity of Howard's PI is O(2n/n) iterations. To date, the tightest bound known across all variants of PI is O(1.7172n) expected iterations for a randomised variant introduced by Mansour and Singh [1999]. We introduce Batch-Switching Policy Iteration (BSPI), a family of deterministic PI algorithms that switches states in ""batches"", taking the batch size b as a parameter. By varying b, BSPI interpolates between Howard's PI and another previously-studied variant called Simple PI [Melekopoglou and Condon, 1994]. Our main contribution is a bound of O(1.6479n) on the number of iterations taken by an instance of BSPI. We believe this is the tightest bound shown yet for any variant of PI.

Existing polynomial time algorithms with proven error guarantees require each column Nj to have l1 norm much smaller than ||(BC)j ||1, which could be very restrictive. In important applications of NMF such as Topic Modeling as well as theoretical noise models (eg. Gaussian with high a), almost every column of Nj violates this condition. We introduce the heavy noise model which only requires the average noise over large subsets of columns to be small. We initiate a study of Noisy NMF under the heavy noise model. We show that our noise model subsumes noise models of theoretical and practical interest (for eg. Gaussian noise of maximum possible σ).

Such methods are further limited by the scope of these features or in other words, their ability to cover the contexts or word dependencies within a sentence. In this work, we focus on reducing such dependencies and propose a domain-invariant framework for the disease name recognition task. In particular, we propose various end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) models for the tasks of disease name recognition and their classification into four pre-defined categories. We also utilize convolution neural network (CNN) in cascade of RNN to get character-based embedded features and employ it with word-embedded features in our model. We compare our models with the state-of-the-art results for the two tasks on NCBI disease dataset. Our results for the disease mention recognition task indicate that state-of-the-art performance can be obtained without relying on feature engineering.

One of the key reasons for this is the lack of personalized shopping experience offered by the brick-and-mortar stores. This work considers the problem of persona based shopping recommendation for such stores to maximize the value for money of the shoppers. For this problem, it proposes a non-polynomial time-complexity optimal dynamic program and a polynomial time-complexity non-optimal heuristic, for making top-k recommendations by taking into account shopper persona and her time and budget constraints. In our empirical evaluations with a mix of realworld data and simulated data, the performance of the heuristic in terms of the persona based recommendations (quantified by similarity scores and items recommended) closely matched (differed by only 8% each with) that of the dynamic program and at the same time heuristic ran at least twice faster compared to the dynamic program. © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The method is conceptually simple: starting from some initial policy, ""policy improvement"" is repeatedly performed to obtain progressively dominating policies, until eventually, an optimal policy is reached. Being remarkably efficient in practice, PI is often favoured over alternative approaches such as Value Iteration and Linear Programming. Unfortunately, even after several decades of study, theoretical bounds on the complexity of PI remain unsatisfactory. For an MDP with n states and k actions, Mansour and Singh (1999) bound the number of iterations taken by Howard's PI, the canonical variant of the method, by O(kn/n). This bound merely improves upon the trivial bound of kn by a linear factor. However, a randomised variant of PI introduced by Mansour and Singh (1999) does yield an exponential improvement, with its expected number of iterations bounded by O (((1 + 2{ log2 (k)) k/2)n). With the objective of furnishing improved upper bounds for PI, we introduce two randomised procedures in this paper. Our first contribution is a routine to find a good initial policy for PI. After evaluating a number of randomly generated policies, this procedure applies a novel criterion to pick one to initialise PI. When PI is subsequently applied, we show that the expected number of policy evaluations-including both the initialisation and the improvement stages-remains bounded in expectation by O(kn/2). The key construction employed in this routine is a total order on the set of policies. Our second contribution is a randomised action-switching rule for PI, which admits a bound of (2 + ln(k -1))n on the expected number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the tightest complexity bound known for PI when k > 3. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The practices however have a few shortcomings. QA puts sole emphasis on agents' organizational compliance aspect whereas C-Sat attempts to measure customers' satisfaction only based on post-dialogue surveys. As a result, outcome of independent QA and C-Sat analysis may not always be in correspondence. Secondly, both processes are retrospective in nature and hence, evidences of bad past dialogues (and consequently bad customer experiences) can only be found after hours or days or weeks depending on their periodicity. Finally, human intensive nature of these practices lead to time and cost overhead while being able to analyze only a small fraction of dialogues. In this paper, we introduce an automatic real-time quality assurance system for contact centers - QART (pronounced cart). QART performs multi-faceted analysis on dialogue utterances, as they happen, using sophisticated statistical and rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It covers various aspects inspired by today's QA and C-Sat practices as well as introduces novel incremental dialogue summarization capability. QART frontend is an interactive dashboard providing views of ongoing dialogues at different granularity enabling agents' supervisors to monitor and take corrective actions as needed.

By recording and analyzing the eye-gaze data, we show that eyemovement patterns vary when sarcasm is understood vis-a-vis when it is not. Motivated by our observations, we propose a system for sarcasm understandability prediction using supervised machine learning. Our system relies on readers' eyemovement parameters and a few textual features, thence, is able to predict sarcasm understandability with an F-score of 93%, which demonstrates its efficacy.

We introduce and study two important special cases of the bribery problem, namely, FRUGALBRIBERY and FRUGAL-$BRIBERY where the briber is frugal in nature. By this, we mean that the briber is only able to influence voters who benefit from the suggestion of the briber. More formally, a voter is vulnerable if the outcome of the election improves according to her own preference when she accepts the suggestion of the briber. In the FRUGAL-BRIBERY problem, the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only the vulnerable votes. In the FRUGAL- $BRIBERY problem, the vulnerable votes have prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only the vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint. We show that both the FRUGAL-BRIBERY and the FRUGAL- $BRIBERY problems are intractable for many commonly used voting rules for weighted as well as unweighted elections. These intractability results demonstrate that bribery is a hard computational problem, in the sense that several special cases of this problem continue to be computationally intractable. This strengthens the view that bribery, although a possible attack on an election in principle, may be infeasible in practice. © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

A key component of these techniques is the use of XOR-based 2-universal hash functions that operate over Boolean domains. Many counting problems arising in probabilistic inference are, however, naturally encoded over finite discrete domains. Techniques based on bit-level (or Boolean) hash functions require these problems to be propositionalized, making it impossible to leverage the remarkable progress made in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solvers that can reason directly over words (or bit-vectors). In this work, we present the first approximate model counter that uses word-level hashing functions, and can directly leverage the power of sophisticated SMT solvers. Empirical evaluation over an extensive suite of benchmarks demonstrates the promise of the approach. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

GPS sensors are a commercially viable option for localization, and are ubiquitous in their use, especially in portable devices. With the proliferation of mobile cameras however, maturing localization algorithms based on computer vision are emerging as a viable alternative. Although both vision and GPS based localization algorithms have many limitations and inaccuracies, there are some interesting complimentarities in their success/failure scenarios that justify an investigation into their joint utilization. Such investigations are further justified considering that many of the modern wearable and mobile computing devices come with sensors for both GPS and vision. In this work, we investigate approaches to reinforce GPS localization with vision algorithms and vice versa. Specifically, we show how noisy GPS signals can be rectified by vision based localization of images captured in the vicinity. Alternatively, we also show how GPS readouts might be used to disambiguate images when they are visually similar looking but belong to different places.

But the inability of the deep CNN features to exhibit invariance to geometric transformations and object compositions poses a great challenge for image search. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the objectness prior over the deep CNN features of image regions for obtaining an invariant image representation. The proposed approach represents the image as a vector of pooled CNN features describing the underlying objects. This representation provides robustness to spatial layout of the objects in the scene and achieves invariance to general geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation and scaling. The proposed approach also leads to a compact representation of the scene, making each image occupy a smaller memory footprint. Experiments show that the proposed representation achieves state of the art retrieval results on a set of challenging benchmark image datasets, while maintaining a compact representation. © 2015 IEEE.",Computational modeling; Databases; Feature extraction; Image representation; Proposals; Search problems; Visualization,Database systems; Feature extraction; Flow visualization; Mathematical transformations; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Compact representation; Computational model; Convolutional neural network; Geometric transformations; Image representations; Object composition; Proposals; Search problem; Computer vision,,,IEEE Computer Society,21607508,9781467367592,,,English,IEEE Comput.

Existing uncalibrated photometric methods either assume that the object has constant albedo or rely on segmenting images into constant albedo regions. The method of this paper does not require the constant albedo assumption and we believe it is the first work of its kind to handle objects with arbitrary albedo under uncalibrated illumination. We first robustly estimate a rank 3 approximation of the observed brightness matrix using an iterative reweighting method. Subsequently, we factorize this rank reduced brightness matrix into the corresponding lighting, albedo and surface normal components. The proposed factorization is shown to be convergent. We experimentally demonstrate the value of our approach by presenting highly accurate three-dimensional reconstructions of a wide variety of objects. Additionally, since any photometric method requires a radiometric calibration of the camera used, we also present a direct radiometric calibration technique for the infra-red camera of the structured-light stereo depth scanner. Unlike existing methods, this calibration technique does not depend on a known calibration object or on the properties of the scene illumination used. © 2015 IEEE.",,,,,IEEE Computer Society,10636919,9781467369640,PIVRE,,English,Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959234068

This involves classifying image patches using the network and considering the class posterior probability vectors as locally extracted semantic descriptors. The image BoS is summarized using a Fisher vector (FV) embedding that exploits the properties of the space of these descriptors. The resulting representation is referred to as a semantic Fisher vector. Two implementations of a semantic FV are investigated. First involves modeling the BoS with a Dirichlet Mixture and computing the Fisher gradients for this model. Due to the difficulty of mixture modeling on a non-Euclidean probability simplex, this approach is shown to be unsuccessful. A second implementation is derived using the interpretation of semantic descriptors as parameters of a multinomial distribution. Like the parameters of any exponential family, these can be projected into their natural parameter space. For a CNN, this is shown equivalent to using inputs of its soft-max layer as patch descriptors. A semantic FV is then computed as a Gaussian Mixture FV in the space of these natural parameters. This representation is shown to outperform other alternatives such as FVs of features from the intermediate CNN layers or a classifier obtained by adapting (fine-tuning) the CNN. The proposed FV represents an embedding for object classification probabilities. As an image representation, therefore, it is complementary to the features obtained from a scene classification CNN. A combination of the two representations is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on MIT Indoor scenes and SUN datasets. © 2015 IEEE.",,,,,IEEE Computer Society,10636919,9781467369640,PIVRE,,English,Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959214051

In addition, egocentric video taken while walking suffers from the left-right movement of the head as the body weight shifts from one leg to another.

Difference in activation patterns of schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects can be identified with the help of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, manual diagnosis using fMRI depends on subjective observation and may be erroneous. This has motivated the pattern recognition and machine learning research community to develop a reliable and efficient decision model for classification of schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects. However, high dimensionality and low availability of fMRI data leads to the curse-of-dimensionality problem which may degrade the performance of decision model. In the present research work, a combination of feature extraction and feature selection techniques is utilised to obtain a reduced set of relevant and non-redundant features for classification of schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects. Features are extracted from pre-processed fMRI data using a general linear model approach. Next Fisher's discriminant ratio, a univariate method, is employed for feature selection i.e. To determine a subset of discriminative features. Further, minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection, a multivariate method, is employed to obtain a set of relevant and non-redundant features which are used for learning a decision model using support vector machine. Two balanced and well-age matched datasets of auditory oddball task derived from a publicly available multisite FBIRN dataset are used for experiments. First dataset consists of fMRI scans of 34 schizophrenia patients and 34 healthy subjects acquired through 1.5 Tesla scanners while second dataset consists of 25 schizophrenia patients and 25 healthy subjects acquired through 3 Tesla scanners. The performance is evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy, and compared with two well-known existing approaches for classification of schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects using fMRI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the existing approaches in terms of sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy. The proposed approach achieves classification accuracy of 88.2% and 78.0% for 1.5 Tesla and 3 Tesla datasets respectively. In addition, the brain regions containing the discriminative features are identified which may be potential biomarkers for diagnosis of schizophrenia using fMRI. © 2014 IEEE.",Classification; Feature extraction; Feature Selection; Functional MRI; Schizophrenia,Artificial intelligence; Brain; Diagnosis; Diseases; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pattern recognition; Scanning; Classification accuracy; Discriminative features; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Functional MRI; General linear modeling; Machine learning research; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Schizophrenia; Classification (of information),,Gelbukh A.Galicia-Haro S.N.Castro Espinoza F.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781479999002,,,English,"Proc.

In this paper, we formulate a criterion for partitioning uniform hypergraphs, and show that a relaxation of this problem is related to the multilinear singular value decomposition (SVD) of symmetric tensors. Using this, we provide a spectral technique for clustering based on higher order affinities, and derive a theoretical bound on the error incurred by this method. We also study the complexity of the algorithm and use Nyström's method and column sampling techniques to develop approximate methods with significantly reduced complexity. Experiments on geometric grouping and motion segmentation demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed methods.

A popular strategy for general query spelling correction is to generate corrections from query logs. However, this strategy is not effective in Email Search for two reasons: 1) query log of any single user is typically not rich enough to provide potential corrections for a new query 2) corrections generated using query logs of other users are not particularly useful since the mail data as well as search intent are highly specific to the user. We address the challenge of designing an effective spelling correction algorithm for Email Search in the absence of query logs. We propose SpEQ, a Machine Learning based approach that generates corrections for misspelled queries directly from the user's own mail data. © Copyright 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

However, conventional algorithms to solve MDP are computationally infeasible in this scenario. Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods tackle this issue by computing approximate solutions. A widely applied ADP method is approximate linear program (ALP) which makes use of linear function approximation and offers theoretical performance guarantees. Nevertheless, the ALP is difficult to solve due to the presence of a large number of constraints and in practice, a reduced linear program (RLP) is solved instead. The RLP has a tractable number of constraints sampled from the original constraints of the ALP. Though the RLP is known to perform well in experiments, theoretical guarantees are available only for a specific RLP obtained under idealized assumptions. In this paper, we generalize the RLP to define a generalized reduced linear program (GRLP) which has a tractable number of constraints that are obtained as positive linear combinations of the original constraints of the ALP. The main contribution of this paper is the novel theoretical framework developed to obtain error bounds for any given GRLP. Central to our framework are two max-norm contraction operators. Our result theoretically justifies linear approximation of constraints. We discuss the implication of our results in the contexts of ADP and reinforcement learning. We also demonstrate via an example in the domain of controlled queues that the experiments conform to the theory.

Analyzing such user-generated content has recently attracted research interest. However, in multilingual societies such as India, analyzing such user-generated content is hard due to several reasons: (1) There are more than 20 official languages but linguistic resources are available mainly for Hindi. It is observed that people frequently use romanized text as it is easy and quick using an English keyboard, resulting in multi-glyphic comments, where the texts are in the same language but in different scripts. Such romanized texts are almost unexplored in machine learning so far. (2) In many cases, comments are made on a specific part of the article rather than the topic of the entire article. Off-the-shelf methods such as correspondence LDA are insufficient to model such relationships between articles and comments. In this paper, we extend the notion of correspondence to model multi-lingual, multi-script, and inter-lingual topics in a unified probabilistic model called the Multi-glyphic Correspondence Topic Model (MCTM). Using several metrics, we verify our approach and show that it improves over the state-of-the-art. Copyright © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

We consider the following scenario: a requester has a set of tasks that must be completed before a deadline; agents (aka crowd workers) arrive over time and it is required to make sequential decisions regarding task allocation and pricing. Agents may have different costs for providing service and these costs are private information of the agents. We assume that agents are not strategic about their arrival times but could be strategic about their costs of service. In addition, agents could be unreliable in the sense of not being able to complete the assigned tasks within the allocated time; these tasks must then be reallocated to other agents to ensure on-time completion of the set of tasks by the deadline. For this setting, we propose two mechanisms: a DPM (Dynamic Price Mechanism) and an ABM (Auction Based Mechanism). Both mechanisms are dominant strategy incentive compatible, budget feasible, and also satisfy ex-post individual rationality for agents who complete the allocated tasks. These mechanisms can be implemented in current day crowdsourcing platforms with minimal changes to the current interaction model.

However, these platforms suffer from high dropout rates due to lack of sustained motivation among the students taking the course. In an effort to address this problem, we propose an incentive-based, instructor-driven approach to orchestrate the interactions in online educational forum.s (OEFs). Our approach takes into account the heterogeneity in skills among the students as well as the limited budget available to the instructor. We first analytically model OEFs in a non-strategic setting using ideas from lumpable continuous time Markov chains and compute expected aggregate transient net-rewards for the instructor and the students. We next consider a strategic setting where we use the rewards computed above to set up a mixed-integer linear program which views an OEF as a single-leader-multiple-followers Stackelberg game and recommends an optimal plan to the instructor for maximizing student participation. Our experimental results reveal several interesting phenomena including a striking non-monotonicity in the level of participation of students vis-a-vis the instructor's arrival rate.

This can lead to significant savings in computation, but these have been predominantly implemented for offline planning. This paper makes two contributions.

Furthermore, using a large number of ""weak"" heuristics could potentially eliminate the need for the careful design of a few. The standard approach to distribute computation in these multi-heuristic searches is to rotate through the heuristics in a round-robin fashion. However, this strategy can be inefficient especially in the case when only a few of the heuristics are leading to progress. In this paper, we present two principled methods to adaptively distribute computation time among the different searches of the MultiHeuristic A∗ algorithm. The first method, Meta-A∗, constructs and searches a meta-graph, which represents the problem of finding the best heuristic as the problem of minimizing the total number of expansions. The second treats the scheduling of searches with different heuristics as a multi-armed bandit problem. It applies Dynamic Thompson Sampling (DTS) to keep track of what searches are making progress the most and continuously re-computes the schedule of searches based on this information. We provide a theoretical analysis and compare our new strategies with the round-robin method on a 12-DOF full-body motion planning problem and on sliding tile puzzle problems.

Analyzing large volumes of Tweets for various applications would require techniques that scale well with the number of Tweets. In this work we come up with a theoretical formulation for sampling Twitter data. We introduce novel statistical metrics to quantify the statistical representativeness of the Tweet sample, and derive sufficient conditions on the number of samples needed for obtaining highly representative Tweet samples. These new statistical metrics quantify the representativeness or goodness of the sample in terms of frequent keyword identification and in terms of restoring public sentiments associated with these keywords. We use uniform random sampling with replacement as our algorithm, and sampling could serve as a first step before using other sophisticated summarization methods to generate summaries for human use. We show that experiments conducted on real Twitter data agree with our bounds. In these experiments, we also compare different kinds of random sampling algorithms. Our bounds are attractive since they do not depend on the total number of Tweets in the universe.

Various scoring functions have been proposed to quantify the quality of such communities. In this paper, we argue that the popular scoring functions suffer from certain limitations. We identify the necessary features that a scoring function should incorporate in order to characterize good community structure and propose a new scoring function, CEIL (Community detection using External and Internal scores in Large networks), which conforms closely with our characterization. We also demonstrate experimentally the superiority of our scoring function over the existing scoring functions. Modularity, a very popular scoring function, exhibits resolution limit, i.e., one cannot find communities that are much smaller in size compared to the size of the network. In many real world networks, community size does not grow in proportion to the network size. This implies that resolution limit is a serious problem in large networks. Modularity is still very popular since it offers many advantages such as fast algorithms for maximizing the score, and non-trivial community structures corresponding to the maxima. We show analytically that the CEIL score does not suffer from resolution limit. We also modify the Louvain method, one of the fastest greedy algorithms for maximizing modularity, to maximize the CEIL score. We show that our algorithm gives the expected communities in synthetic networks as opposed to maximizing modularity. We also show that the community labels given by our algorithm matches closely with the ground truth community labels in real world networks.

Existing temporal video segmentation techniques are based on low-level features, and are usually suitable for discovering short, homogeneous shots rather than diverse scenes, each of which contains several such shots. We define scenes in terms of semantic entities (eg. persons). This is the first attempt at entity-driven scene discovery in videos, without using meta-data like scripts. The problem is hard because we have no explicit prior information about the entities and the scenes. However such sequential data exhibit temporal coherence in multiple ways, and this provides implicit cues. To capture these, we propose a Bayesian generative model-EntScene, that represents entities with mixture components and scenes with discrete distributions over these components. The most challenging part of this approach is the inference, as it involves complex interactions of latent variables. To this end, we propose an algorithm based on Dynamic Blocked Gibbs Sampling, that attempts to jointly learn the components and the segmentation, by progressively merging an initial set of short segments. The proposed algorithm compares favourably against suitably designed baselines on several TV-series videos.

In this work we model multi-way relations as hypergraphs and extend the discriminative random walk (DRW) framework, originally proposed for transductive inference on single graphs, to the case of multiple hypergraphs. We use the extended DRW framework for inference on multi-view, multi-relational data in a natural way, by representing attribute descriptions of the data also as hypergraphs. We further exploit the structure of hypergraphs to modify the random walk operator to take into account class imbalance in the data. This work is among very few approaches to explicitly address class imbalance in the innetwork classification setting, using random walks. We compare our approach to methods proposed for inference on hypergraphs, and to methods proposed for multi-view data and show that empirically we achieve better performance.

A series of recent works (Keshavan, 2012; Jain et al., 2013; Hardt, 2014) have proposed fast non-convex optimization based iterative algorithms to solve this problem. However, the sample complexity in all these results is sub-optimal in its dependence on the rank, condition number and the desired accuracy. In this paper, we present a fast iterative algorithm that solves the matrix completion problem by observing O ( nr5 log3 n ) entries, which is independent of the condition number and the desired accuracy. The run time of our algorithm is O ( nr7 log3 n log 1/∈) which is near linear in the dimension of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first near linear time algorithm for exact matrix completion with finite sample complexity (i.e. independent of ∈). Our algorithm is based on a well known projected gradient descent method, where the projection is onto the (nonconvex) set of low rank matrices. There are two key ideas in our result: 1) our argument is based on a ℓ ∞ norm potential function (as opposed to the spectral norm) and provides a novel way to obtain perturbation bounds for it. 2) we prove and use a natural extension of the Davis-Kahan theorem to obtain perturbation bounds on the best low rank approximation of matrices with good eigen gap.

In this work, we study the consistency of hierarchical classification algorithms with respect to a natural loss, namely the tree distance metric on the hierarchy tree of class labels, via the usage of calibrated surrogates. We first show that the Bayes optimal classifier for this loss classifies an instance according to the deepest node in the hierarchy such that the total conditional probability of the subtree rooted at the node is greater than 1\2. We exploit this insight to develop new consistent algorithm for hierarchical classification, that makes use of an algorithm known to be consistent for the ""multiclass classification with reject option (MCRO)"" problem as a subroutine. Our experiments on a number of benchmark datasets show that the resulting algorithm, which we term OvA-Cascade, gives improved performance over other state-of-the-art hierarchical classification algorithms. © Copyright 2015 by International Machine Learning Society (IMLS).

Such measures have spurred much interest and pose specific challenges to learning algorithms since their non-additive nature precludes a direct application of well-studied large scale optimization methods such as stochastic gradient descent. In this paper we reveal that for two large families of performance measures that can be expressed as functions of true positive/negative rates, it is indeed possible to implement point stochastic updates. The families we consider are concave and pseudo-linear functions of TPR, TNR which cover several popularly used performance measures such as F-measure, G-mean and H-mean. Our core contribution is an adaptive linearization scheme for these families, using which we develop optimization techniques that enable truly point-based stochastic updates. For concave performance measures we propose SPADE, a stochastic primal dual solver; for pseudo-linear measures we propose STAMP, a stochastic alternate maximization procedure. Both methods have crisp convergence guarantees, demonstrate significant speedups over existing methods-often by an order of magnitude or more, and give similar or more accurate predictions on test data.",,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Accurate prediction; Adaptive linearization; Large-scale optimization; Optimization techniques; Optimizing performance; Performance measure; Pseudo linear; Stochastic gradient descent; Stochastic systems,,Bach F.Blei D.,International Machine Learning Society (IMLS),,9781510810587,,,English,"Int.

It was shown recently that when the underlying pairwise preferences are acyclic, several algorithms including the Rank Centrality algorithm, the Matrix Borda algorithm, and the SVM-RankAggregation algorithm succeed in recovering a ranking that minimizes a global pair-wise disagreement error (Rajkumar and Agarwal, 2014). In this paper, we consider settings where pairwise preferences can contain cycles. In such settings, one may still like to be able to recover 'good' items at the top of the ranking. For example, if a Condorcet winner exists that beats every other item, it is natural to ask that this be ranked at the top. More generally, several tournament solution concepts such as the top cycle, Copeland set, Markov set and others have been proposed in the social choice literature for choosing a set of winners in the presence of cycles. We show that existing algorithms can fail to perform well in terms of ranking Condorcet winners and various natural tournament solution sets at the top. We then give alternative ranking algorithms that provably rank Condorcet winners, top cycles, and other tournament solution sets of interest at the top. In all cases, we give finite sample complexity bounds for our algorithms to recover such winners. As a by-product of our analysis, we also obtain an improved sample complexity bound for the Rank Centrality algorithm to recover an optimal ranking under a Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) condition, which answers an open question of Rajkumar and Agarwal (2014).",,Artificial intelligence; Decision theory; Learning systems; Recovery; Sampling; Stochastic systems; Alternative ranking; Condorcet winner; Finite samples; Sample complexity bounds; Social choice; Solution concepts; Solution set; Algorithms,,Bach F.Blei D.,International Machine Learning Society (IMLS),,9781510810587,,,English,"Int.

This construction, coupled with a Bernoulli-Poisson link function for each label of the binary label vector, leads to a model with a computational cost that scales in the number of positive labels in the label matrix. This makes the model particularly appealing for real-world multi-label learning problems where the label matrix is usually very massive but highly sparse.

Embedding based approaches attempt to make training and prediction tractable by assuming that the training label matrix is low-rank and reducing the effective number of labels by projecting the high dimensional label vectors onto a low dimensional linear subspace. Still, leading embedding approaches have been unable to deliver high prediction accuracies, or scale to large problems as the low rank assumption is violated in most real world applications. In this paper we develop the SLEEC classifier to address both limitations. The main technical contribution in SLEEC is a formulation for learning a small ensemble of local distance preserving embeddings which can accurately predict infrequently occurring (tail) labels. This allows SLEEC to break free of the traditional low-rank assumption and boost classification accuracy by learning embeddings which preserve pairwise distances between only the nearest label vectors. We conducted extensive experiments on several real-world, as well as benchmark data sets and compared our method against state-of-the-art methods for extreme multi-label classification. Experiments reveal that SLEEC can make significantly more accurate predictions then the state-of-the-art methods including both embedding-based (by as much as 35%) as well as tree-based (by as much as 6%) methods.

More specifically, for a data matrix X ∈ ℝp×n and an underlying model w∗, the response vector is generated as y = XTw∗ +b where b ∈ ℝn is the corruption vector supported over at most C · n coordinates. Existing exact recovery results for RLSR focus solely on L1-penalty based convex formulations and impose relatively strict model assumptions such as requiring the corruptions b to be selected independently of X. In this work, we study a simple hard-thresholding algorithm called TORRENT which, under mild conditions on X, can recover w∗ exactly even if b corrupts the response variables in an adversarial manner, i.e. both the support and entries of b are selected adversarially after observing X and w∗. Our results hold under deterministic assumptions which are satisfied if X is sampled from any sub-Gaussian distribution. Finally unlike existing results that apply only to a fixedw∗, generated independently of X, our results are universal and hold for any w∗ ∈ ℝp. Next, we propose gradient descent-based extensions of TORRENT that can scale efficiently to large scale problems, such as high dimensional sparse recovery. and prove similar recovery guarantees for these extensions.

Our constraint formulation is strictly more expressive than existing representations, yet easy to operate on.

A key advantage of these lifted algorithms is that they have much smaller computational complexity than propositional algorithms when symmetries are present in the MLN and these symmetries can be detected using lifted inference rules. Unfortunately, lifted inference rules are sound but not complete and can often miss many symmetries. This is problematic because when symmetries cannot be exploited, lifted inference algorithms ground the MLN, and search for solutions in the much larger propositional space. In this paper, we present a novel approach, which cleverly introduces new symmetries at the time of grounding. Our main idea is to partition the ground atoms and force the inference algorithm to treat all atoms in each part as indistinguishable. We show that by systematically and carefully refining (and growing) the partitions, we can build advanced any-time and any-space MAP inference algorithms. Our experiments on several real-world datasets clearly show that our new algorithm is superior to previous approaches and often finds useful symmetries in the search space that existing lifted inference rules are unable to detect.",,Algorithms; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Information science; Inference algorithm; Inference rules; MAP inferences; Markov logic networks; Real-world datasets; Search spaces; Inference engines,,Cortes C.Lee D.D.Garnett R.Lawrence N.D.Sugiyama M.,Neural information processing systems foundation,10495258,,,,English,Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84965096638

However, the choice of optimal embedding and an efficient algorithm to compute the same remains open. In this paper, we show that orthonormal representations, a class of unit-sphere graph embeddings are PAC learnable. Existing PAC-based analysis do not apply as the VC dimension of the function class is infinite. We propose an alternative PAC-based bound, which do not depend on the VC dimension of the underlying function class, but is related to the famous Lovasz θ function. The main contribution of the paper is SPORE, a SPectral regularized ORthonormal Embedding for graph transduction, derived from the PAC bound. SPORE is posed as a non-smooth convex function over an elliptope. These problems are usually solved as semi-definite programs (SDPs) with time complexity 0(n6). We present, Infeasible Inexact proximal (IIP): an Inexact proximal method which performs subgradient procedure on an approximate projection, not necessarily feasible. IIP is more scalable than SDP, has an 0(1/√T) convergence, and is generally applicable whenever a suitable approximate projection is available. We use IIP to compute SPORE where the approximate projection step is computed by FISTA, an accelerated gradient descent procedure. We show that the method has a convergence rate of 0(1/√T). The proposed algorithm easily scales to 1000's of vertices, while the standard SDP computation does not scale beyond few hundred vertices. Furthermore, the analysis presented here easily extends to the multiple graph setting.",,Algorithms; Functions; Information science; Approximate projection; Convergence rates; Convex functions; Gradient descent; Graph embeddings; Inexact proximal methods; Optimal embedding; Semidefinite programs; Bacteriophages,,Cortes C.Lee D.D.Garnett R.Lawrence N.D.Sugiyama M.,Neural information processing systems foundation,10495258,,,,English,Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84965175130

Desirable properties of the chosen topics include document coverage, specificity, topic diversity, and topic homogeneity, each of which, we show, is naturally modeled by a submodular function.

A dominant approach to this problem has been to use an ICU score system such as, for example, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) system, and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) system, to compute a certain severity score for a patient from a set of clinical observations, and apply a logistic regression model on this score to obtain an estimate of the probability of mortality for the patient, owing to their simplicity, these methods are widely used by clinicians. However, existing ICU score systems are built from a fixed set of patient data, and often perform poorly when applied to a patient population with different characteristics, also, with changes in patient characteristics, a score system built from a given patient data set becomes suboptimal over time. Moreover, most of these score systems are built using semi-automated procedures that require some amount of manual intervention, making it difficult to adapt them to a new patient population. Thus there is a huge need for adaptive methods that can automatically learn predictive models from a given set of patient data, tailored to perform well on similar patient populations. Indeed, there has been much work in recent years on applying various machine learning methods to this problem, however these methods learn different representations from the score systems preferred by clinicians. In this work, we develop a machine learning method based on orthogonal matching pursuit that automatically learns a score system type model, which enjoys the benefits of both worlds: like other machine learning methods, it is adaptive, like standard score systems, it uses a representation that is easy for clinicians to understand. Experiments on real-world patient data sets show that our method outperforms standard ICU score systems, and performs at least as well as other machine learning methods that employ more complex representations. As an added advantage of using the OMP approach, one can use a group-sparse variant of OMP which allows learning models with similar performance using a smaller number of clinical observations, we include experiments with this as well. © 2014 IEEE.",Intensive care units; logistic regression; mortality rate prediction; orthogonal matching pursuit; score systems,Artificial intelligence; Forecasting; Hospital data processing; Learning systems; Medicine; Patient treatment; Physiology; Population statistics; Quality control; Regression analysis; Acute physiology and chronic health evaluations; Automated procedures; Critical care medicine; Logistic Regression modeling; Logistic regressions; Machine learning methods; Mortality rate; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Intensive care units,,Ferri C.Qu G.Chen X.Wani M.A.Angelov P.Lai J.-H.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781479974153,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

A dominant theoretical and algorithmic framework for the problem has been to reduce bipartite ranking to pairwise classification; in particular, it is well known that the bipartite ranking regret can be formulated as a pairwise classification regret, which in turn can be upper bounded using usual regret bounds for classification problems. Recently, Kotlowski et al. (2011) showed regret bounds for bipartite ranking in terms of the regret associated with balanced versions of the standard (non-pairwise) logistic and exponential losses. In this paper, we show that such (non-pairwise) surrogate regret bounds for bipartite ranking can be obtained in terms of a broad class of proper (composite) losses that we term as strongly proper. Our proof technique is much simpler than that of Kotlowski et al. (2011), and relies on properties of proper (composite) losses as elucidated recently by Reid and Williamson (2010, 2011) and others. Our result yields explicit surrogate bounds (with no hidden balancing terms) in terms of a variety of strongly proper losses, including for example logistic, exponential, squared and squared hinge losses as special cases. An important consequence is that standard algorithms minimizing a (non-pairwise) strongly proper loss, such as logistic regression and boosting algorithms (assuming a universal function class and appropriate regularization), are in fact consistent for bipartite ranking; moreover, our results allow us to quantify the bipartite ranking regret in terms of the corresponding surrogate regret.

In this paper, we consider the question of statistical consistency of such methods. We focus on settings where the binary problems are solved by minimizing a binary surrogate loss, and derive general conditions on the binary surrogate loss under which the one-vs-all and all-pairs code matrices yield consistent algorithms with respect to the multiclass 0-1 loss. We then consider general multiclass learning problems defined by a general multiclass loss, and derive conditions on the output code matrix and binary surrogates under which the resulting algorithm is consistent with respect to the target multiclass loss. We also consider probabilistic code matrices, where one reduces a multiclass problem to a set of class probability labeled binary problems, and show that these can yield benefits in the sense of requiring a smaller number of binary problems to achieve overall consistency. Our analysis makes interesting connections with the theory of proper composite losses (Buja et al., 2005; Reid and Williamson, 2010); these play a role in constructing the right 'decoding' for converting the predictions on the binary problems to the final multiclass prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first work that comprehensively studies consistency properties of output code based methods for multiclass learning. © 2014 H.G. Ramaswamy, B.S. Babu, S. Agarwal & R.C.

Our approach is based on the following key result that we prove in the paper: if an MLN has no shared terms then MAP inference over it can be reduced to MAP inference over a Markov network having the following properties: (i) the number of random variables in the Markov network is equal to the number of first-order atoms in the MLN; and (ii) the domain size of each variable in the Markov network is equal to the number of groundings of the corresponding firstorder atom. We show that inference over this Markov network is exponentially more efficient than ground inference, namely inference over the Markov network obtained by grounding all firstorder atoms in the MLN. We improve this result further by showing that if non-shared MLNs contain no self joins, namely every atom appears at most once in each of its formulas, then all variables in the corresponding Markov network need only be bi-valued. Our approach is quite general and can be easily applied to an arbitrary MLN by simply grounding all of its shared terms. The key feature of our approach is that because we reduce lifted inference to propositional inference, we can use any propositional MAP inference algorithm for performing lifted MAP inference. Within our approach, we experimented with two propositional MAP inference algorithms: Gurobi and MaxWalkSAT. Our experiments on several benchmark MLNs clearly demonstrate our approach is superior to ground MAP inference in terms of scalability and solution quality.",,Artificial intelligence; Atoms; Benchmarking; Computer circuits; Markov processes; Probabilistic logics; Reconfigurable hardware; Domain size; First-order; Key feature; MAP inferences; Markov logic networks; Markov networks; New approaches; Solution quality; Inference engines,,Kaski S.Kaski S.Corander J.,Microtome Publishing,15324435,,,,English,J.

This problem is motivated by several practical applications such as crowdsourcing, recommendation systems, and learning Boolean functions. The existing solutions either heavily rely on the fact that the number of mixtures is finite or have sample/time complexity that is exponential in the number of mixtures. In this paper, we introduce a polynomial time/sample complexity method for learning a mixture of r discrete product distributions over {1,2,..., l}n, for general l and r. We show that our approach is consistent and further provide finite sample guarantees. We use recently developed techniques from tensor decompositions for moment matching. A crucial step in these approaches is to construct certain tensors with low-rank spectral decompositions. These tensors are typically estimated from the sample moments. The main challenge in learning mixtures of discrete product distributions is that the corresponding low-rank tensors cannot be obtained directly from the sample moments. Instead, we need to estimate a low-rank matrix using only off-diagonal entries, and estimate a tensor using a few linear measurements. We give an alternating minimization based method to estimate the low-rank matrix, and formulate the tensor estimation problem as a least-squares problem. © 2014 P. Jain & S.

Existing methods that fuse depth with normal estimates use an external RGB camera to obtain photometric information and treat the depth camera as a black box that provides a low quality depth estimate. Our contribution to such methods are two fold. Firstly, instead of using an extra RGB camera, we use the infra-red (IR) camera of the depth camera system itself to directly obtain high resolution photometric information. We believe that ours is the first method to use an IR depth camera system in this manner. Secondly, photometric methods applied to complex objects result in numerous holes in the reconstructed surface due to shadows and self-occlusions. To mitigate this problem, we develop a simple and effective multiview reconstruction approach that fuses depth and normal information from multiple viewpoints to build a complete, consistent and accurate 3D surface representation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method to generate high quality 3D surface reconstructions for some complex 3D figurines. © 2014 IEEE.",3D reconstruction; depth camera; fusion methods; Kinect; photometric stereo,Computer vision; Face recognition; Pattern recognition; Photometry; Stereo image processing; 3D reconstruction; Depth camera; Fusion methods; Kinect; Photometric stereo; Cameras,"Haque, S.M.; Indian Institute of ScienceIndia",,IEEE Computer Society,10636919,9781479951178; 9781479951178,PIVRE,,English,Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911441058

In this paper, we extend this idea towards learning relative attributes using local parts that are shared across categories. First, instead of using a global representation, we introduce a part-based representation combining a pair of images that specifically compares corresponding parts. Then, with each part we associate a locally adaptive 'significance-coefficient' that represents its discriminative ability with respect to a particular attribute. For each attribute, the significance-coefficients are learned simultaneously with a max-margin ranking model in an iterative manner. Compared to the baseline method, the new method is shown to achieve significant improvement in relative attribute prediction accuracy.

We devise an algorithm for judicious sub-image selection so that the camera motion can be deciphered correctly, irrespective of the presence or absence of occluder.

Most popular methods represent each fingerprint as an unordered set of minutiae with variable cardinality and the matching algorithms are left with the task of finding the best correspondence between the two sets of minutiae. While this makes the representation more flexible and matching more accurate, the task becomes computationally intensive. Fixed length representations with aligned features are highly efficient to match. However, creating an aligned representation without the knowledge of the sample to which it is to be matched, makes the problem of representation more complex. Some of the fixed-length representations only provide partial alignment, leaving the rest to the matching stage. In this paper, we propose a fixed length representation for fingerprints that provides exact alignment between the features, thus enabling high-speed matching with minimal computational effort. The representation extends the idea of object representation using bag of words into a bag of minutiae neighborhoods. The representation is provably invariant to affine transformations (rotation, translation and uniform scaling), and is shown to be highly discriminative for the task of verification. Experimental results on FVC 2002 and 2004 datasets clearly show the superiority of the representation with competing methods. As the proposed representation can be computed from the standard minutiae templates, the method is applicable to existing datasets, where the original fingerprint images are not available. © 2014 IEEE.",biometrics; clustering; fingerprint; fingerprint matching; fingerprint representation; fixed length representation,Algorithms; Biometrics; Computer vision; Image matching; Algorithms; Biometrics; Computer vision; Image matching; Pattern recognition; clustering; fingerprint; Fingerprint matching; Fingerprint representation; fixed length representation; Pattern matching; Pattern matching,"Vij, A.; International Institute of Information TechnologyIndia",,IEEE Computer Society,21607508,9781479943098; 9781479943098,,,English,IEEE Comput.

For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset which contains actions from both the perspectives captured using a head-mounted camera. We employ a motion pyramidal structure for grouping the dense trajectory features. The relative strengths of motion along the trajectories are used to compute different bag-of-words descriptors and concatenated to form a single descriptor for the action. The motion pyramidal approach performs better than the baseline improved trajectory descriptors. The method achieves 96.7% on the JPL interaction dataset and 61.8% on our NUS interaction dataset. The same is used to detect actions in long video sequences and achieves average precision of 0.79 on JPL interaction dataset. © 2014 IEEE.",First-person video; Interaction recognition,Cameras; Computer vision; Cameras; Computer vision; Trajectories; Action recognition; First-person perspectives; First-person video; Interaction recognition; Pyramidal structures; Real-world scenario; Relative strength; Trajectory features; First person; Head mounted Camera; Trajectories; Pattern recognition,"Narayan, S.; Dept. of Electrical Engg., IIScIndia",,IEEE Computer Society,21607508,9781479943098; 9781479943098,,,English,IEEE Comput.

Browsing such long unstructured videos is time consuming and tedious. Segmentation into meaningful chapters is an important first step towards adding structure to egocentric videos, enabling efficient browsing, indexing and summarization of the long videos. Two sources of information for video segmentation are (i) the motion of the camera wearer, and (ii) the objects and activities recorded in the video. In this paper we address the motion cues for video segmentation. Motion based segmentation is especially difficult in egocentric videos when the camera is constantly moving due to natural head movement of the wearer. We propose a robust temporal segmentation of egocentric videos into a hierarchy of motion classes using a new Cumulative Displacement Curves. Unlike instantaneous motion vectors, segmentation using integrated motion vectors performs well even in dynamic and crowded scenes. No assumptions are made on the underlying scene structure and the method works in indoor as well as outdoor situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using publicly available videos as well as choreographed videos. We also suggest an approach to detect the fixation of wearer's gaze in the walking portion of the egocentric videos. © 2014 IEEE.",,Computer vision; Image compression; Image segmentation; Pattern recognition; Displacement curve; Head movements; Instantaneous motion; Motion based segmentation; Scene structure; Temporal segmentations; Video segmentation; Wearable cameras; Cameras,"Poleg, Y.; Hebrew University of JerusalemIsrael",,IEEE Computer Society,10636919,9781479951178; 9781479951178,PIVRE,,English,Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911434577

Unlike these works, in this paper, we propose to enhance the semantic representation of an image. We aim to learn the most important visual components of an image and how they interact in order to classify the objects correctly. To achieve our objective, we propose a new latent SVM model for category level object classification. Starting from image-level annotations, we jointly learn the object class and its context in terms of spatial location (where) and appearance (what). Furthermore, to regularize the complexity of the model we learn the spatial and co-occurrence relations between adjacent regions, such that unlikely configurations are penalized. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently enhance results on the challenging Pascal VOC dataset in terms of classification and weakly supervised detection. We also show how semantic representation can be exploited for finding similar content. © 2014 IEEE.",latent svm; object classification; weakly supervised detection,Classification (of information); Computer vision; Image coding; Pattern recognition; Semantics; Coding techniques; Feature pooling; Latent SVM; Low level representation; Object classification; Semantic representation; Spatial location; Visual components; Image classification,"Bilen, H.; ESAT-PSI-VISICS/iMinds, KU LeuvenBelgium",,IEEE Computer Society,10636919,9781479951178; 9781479951178,PIVRE,,English,Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911393964

Yet it is common practice in computer vision to employ the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which optimizes a surrogate 0-1 loss. The popularity of SVM can be attributed to its empirical performance. Specifically, in fully supervised settings, SVM tends to provide similar accuracy to the AP-SVM classifier, which directly optimizes an AP-based loss. However, we hypothesize that in the significantly more challenging and practically useful setting of weakly supervised learning, it becomes crucial to optimize the right accuracy measure. In order to test this hypothesis, we propose a novel latent AP-SVM that minimizes a carefully designed upper bound on the AP-based loss function over weakly supervised samples.

The presence of different motions (represented as a 1D histogram) has been used in the traditional bag-of-words (BoW) approach for recognizing actions. However the interactions among the motions also form a crucial part of an action. Different object-parts have varying degrees of interactions with the other parts during an action cycle. It is these interactions we want to quantify in order to bring in additional information about the actions. In this paper we propose a causality based approach for quantifying the interactions to aid action classification. Granger causality is used to compute the cause and effect relationships for pairs of motion trajectories of a video. A 2D histogram descriptor for the video is constructed using these pairwise measures. Our proposed method of obtaining pairwise measures for videos is also applicable for large datasets. We have conducted experiments on challenging action recognition databases such as HMDB51 and UCF50 and shown that our causality descriptor helps in encoding additional information regarding the actions and performs on par with the state-of-the art approaches.

The energy function associated with the proposed video seams provides temporal linking of patches across frames, to accurately segment the object. The proposed energy function takes into account the similarity of patches along the seam, temporal consistency of motion and spatial coherency of seams. Label propagation is achieved with high fidelity in the critical boundary regions, utilising the proposed patch seams.

We show that learning can be done tractably, even when the weight matrix is stretched to infinity, for some specific models. We also study tractable algorithms for implementing stretching in deep convolutional architectures in an iterative manner and derive bounds for its convergence. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed stretched deep convolutional networks are capable of achieving good performance for many object recognition tasks. More importantly, for a fixed network architecture, one can achieve much better accuracy using stretching rather than learning the weights using backpropagation.

Multiple Kernel Learning subject to lp≥ 1 regularization (lp-MKL) has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective techniques for non-linear feature selection. However, state-of-the-art lp-MKL algorithms are too computationally expensive to be invoked thousands of times to determine the entire path. We propose a novel conjecture which states that, for certain lp-MKL formulations, the number of features selected in the optimal solution mono- tonically decreases as p is decreased from an initial value to unity. We prove the conjecture, for a generic family of kernel target alignment based formulations, and show that the feature weights themselves decay (grow) monotonically once they are below (above) a certain threshold at optimality. This allows us to develop a path following algorithm that systematically generates optimal feature sets of decreasing size. The proposed algorithm sets certain feature weights di-rectly to zero for potentially large intervals of p thereby reducing optimization costs while simul-taneously providing approximation guarantees. We empirically demonstrate that our formulation can lead to classification accuracies which are as much as 10% higher on benchmark data sets not only as compared to other lp-MKL formulations and uniform kernel baselines but also leading feature selection methods. We further demonstrate that our algorithm reduces training time significantly over other path following algorithms and state-of-the-art lp-MKL optimizers such as SMO-MKL. In particular, we generate the entire feature selection path for data sets with a hundred thousand features in approximately half an hour on standard hardware. Entire path generation for such data set is well beyond the scaling capabilities of other methods.

However, in order to do so, these methods make assumptions that can be quite restrictive in practice. More specifically, the methods assume that: a) the observed indices are sampled uniformly at random, and b) for every new matrix, the observed indices are sampled afresh. In this work, we address these issues by providing a universal recovery guarantee for matrix completion that works for a variety of sampling schemes. In particular, we show that if the set of sampled indices come from the edges of a bipartite graph with large spectral gap (i.e. gap between the first and the second singular value), then the nuclear norm minimization based method exactly recovers all low-rank matrices that satisfy certain incoherence properties. Moreover, we also show that under certain stricter incoherence conditions, O(nr2) uniformly sampled entries are enough to recover any rank-r n × n matrix, in contrast to the O(nr log n) sample complexity required by other matrix completion algorithms as well as existing analyses of the nuclear norm method.

It is well known that standard algorithms such as logistic regression do not perform well in this setting as they tend to underestimate the probability of the rare class. Common fixes include under-sampling and weighting, together with various correction schemes. Recently, Wang & Dey (2010) suggested the use of a parametrized family of asymmetric link functions based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, which has been used for modeling rare events in statistics. The approach showed promising initial results, but combined with the logarithmic CPE loss implicitly used in their work, it results in a non-convex composite loss that is difficult to optimize. In this paper, we use tools from the theory of proper composite losses (Buja et al., 2005; Reid & Williamson, 2010) to construct a canonical underlying CPE loss corresponding to the GEV link, which yields a convex proper composite loss that we call the GEV-canonical loss; this loss can be tailored to CPE settings where one class is rare, and is easily minimized using an IRLS-type algorithm similar to that used for logistic regression. Our experiments on both synthetic and real data suggest that the resulting algorithm-which we term GEV-canonical regression-performs well compared to common approaches such as under-sampling and weights-correction for this problem.

We first show that, under a 'time-reversibility' or Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) condition on the distribution, the rank centrality (PageRank) and least squares (HodgeRank) algorithms both converge to an optimal ranking. Next, we show that a matrix version of the Borda count algorithm, and more surprisingly, an algorithm which performs maximum likelihood estimation under a BTL assumption, both converge to an optimal ranking under a 'low-noise' condition that is strictly more general than BTL. Finally, we propose a new SVM-based algorithm for rank aggregation from pairwise data, and show that this converges to an optimal ranking under an even more general condition that we term 'generalized low-noise'.

Next, we use the insights obtained from the theoretical analysis, to propose a novel convex formulation that automatically learns the kernel to be employed in the MMD-based estimation.

However, existing approaches do not adequately address two key challenges: (a) scaling up to problems with a large number (say millions) of labels, and (b) handling data with missing labels. In this paper, we directly address both these problems by studying the multi-label problem in a generic empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our framework, despite being simple, is surprisingly able to encompass several recent label-compression based methods which can be derived as special cases of our method. To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the structure of specific loss functions-such as the squared loss function-to obtain efficient algorithms.

We construct distributional thesauri based networks from data at different time points and cluster each of them separately to obtain word-centric sense clusters corresponding to the different time points. Subsequently, we compare these sense clusters of two different time points to find if (i) there is birth of a new sense or (ii) if an older sense has got split into more than one sense or (iii) if a newer sense has been formed from the joining of older senses or (iv) if a particular sense has died.

Manual evaluation indicates that the algorithm could correctly identify 60.4% birth cases from a set of 48 randomly picked samples and 57% split/join cases from a set of 21 randomly picked samples. Remarkably, in 44% cases the birth of a novel sense is attested by WordNet, while in 46% cases and 43% cases split and join are respectively confirmed by WordNet.

However the choice of optimal embedding remains an open issue. Orthonormal representation of graphs, a class of embeddings over the unit sphere, was introduced by Lovász [2]. In this paper, we show that there exists orthonormal representations which are statistically consistent over a large class of graphs, including power law and random graphs. This result is achieved by extending the notion of consistency designed in the inductive setting to graph transduction. As part of the analysis, we explicitly derive relationships between the Rademacher complexity measure and structural properties of graphs, such as the chromatic number. We further show the fraction of vertices of a graph G, on n nodes, that need to be labelled for the learning algorithm to be consistent, also known as labelled sample complexity, is Ω(υ(G)/n)1/4 where υ(G) is the famous Lovász υ function of the graph. This, for the first time, relates labelled sample complexity to graph connectivity properties, such as the density of graphs. In the multiview setting, whenever individual views are expressed by a graph, it is a well known heuristic that a convex combination of Laplacians [7] tend to improve accuracy.

The inference problem of recovering topics from such a collection of documents drawn from admixtures, is NP-hard. Making a strong assumption called separability, [4] gave the first provable algorithm for inference. For the widely used LDA model, [6] gave a provable algorithm using clever tensor-methods. But [4, 6] do not learn topic vectors with bounded l<inf>1</inf> error (a natural measure for probability vectors). Our aim is to develop a model which makes intuitive and empirically supported assumptions and to design an algorithm with natural, simple components such as SVD, which provably solves the inference problem for the model with bounded l<inf>1</inf> error. A topic in LDA and other models is essentially characterized by a group of co-occurring words. Motivated by this, we introduce topic specific Catchwords, a group of words which occur with strictly greater frequency in a topic than any other topic individually and are required to have high frequency together rather than individually. A major contribution of the paper is to show that under this more realistic assumption, which is empirically verified on real corpora, a singular value decomposition (SVD) based algorithm with a crucial pre-processing step of thresholding, can provably recover the topics from a collection of documents drawn from Dominant admixtures. Dominant admixtures are convex combination of distributions in which one distribution has a significantly higher contribution than the others. Apart from the simplicity of the algorithm, the sample complexity has near optimal dependence on w<inf>0</inf>, the lowest probability that a topic is dominant, and is better than [4]. Empirical evidence shows that on several real world corpora, both Catchwords and Dominant admixture assumptions hold and the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms the state of the art [5].",,Algorithms; Information science; Singular value decomposition; Statistics; Collection of documents; Convex combinations; High frequency HF; Inference problem; Latent dirichlet allocations; Pre-processing step; Probability vector; Sample complexity; Inference engines,,Cortes C.Ghahramani Z.Welling M.Weinberger K.Q.Lawrence N.D.,Neural information processing systems foundation,10495258,,,,English,Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937911334

Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, India","Lifted inference algorithms for probabilistic first-order logic frameworks such as Markov logic networks (MLNs) have received significant attention in recent years. These algorithms use so called lifting rules to identify symmetries in the first-order representation and reduce the inference problem over a large probabilistic model to an inference problem over a much smaller model. In this paper, we present two new lifting rules, which enable fast MAP inference in a large class of MLNs. Our first rule uses the concept of single occurrence equivalence class of logical variables, which we define in the paper. The rule states that the MAP assignment over an MLN can be recovered from a much smaller MLN, in which each logical variable in each single occurrence equivalence class is replaced by a constant (i.e., an object in the domain of the variable). Our second rule states that we can safely remove a subset of formulas from the MLN if all equivalence classes of variables in the remaining MLN are single occurrence and all formulas in the subset are tautology (i.e., evaluate to true) at extremes (i.e., assignments with identical truth value for groundings of a predicate). We prove that our two new rules are sound and demonstrate via a detailed experimental evaluation that our approach is superior in terms of scalability and MAP solution quality to the state of the art approaches.",,Algorithms; Formal logic; Inference engines; Information science; Quality control; Domain independents; Experimental evaluation; First order logic; First-order representation; Inference algorithm; Markov logic networks; Probabilistic modeling; State-of-the-art approach; Equivalence classes,,Ghahramani Z.Welling M.Lawrence N.D.Cortes C.Weinberger K.Q.,Neural information processing systems foundation,10495258,,,,English,Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937828911

We ask the following question: how many sampled entries do we need, to efficiently and exactly reconstruct a tensor with a low-rank orthogonal decomposition? We propose a novel alternating minimization based method which iteratively refines estimates of the singular vectors. We show that under certain standard assumptions, our method can recover a three-mode n × n × n dimensional rank-r tensor exactly from O(n3/2r5 log4 n) randomly sampled entries. In the process of proving this result, we solve two challenging sub-problems for tensors with missing data. First, in analyzing the initialization step, we prove a generalization of a celebrated result by Szemerédie et al. on the spectrum of random graphs. We show that this initialization step alone is sufficient to achieve the root mean squared error on the parameters bounded by C(r2n3/2(log n)4|Ω|) from |Ω| observed entries for some constant C independent of n and r. Next, we prove global convergence of alternating minimization with this good initialization.

Given a set of positive (relevant) and negative (non-relevant) samples, the parameters of a retrieval system can be estimated using the AP-SVM framework, which minimizes a regularized convex upper bound on the empirical AP loss. However, the high computational complexity of loss-augmented inference, which is required for learning an AP-SVM, prohibits its use with large training datasets. To alleviate this deficiency, we propose three complementary approaches. The first approach guarantees an asymptotic decrease in the computational complexity of loss-augmented inference by exploiting the problem structure. The second approach takes advantage of the fact that we do not require a full ranking during loss-augmented inference. This helps us to avoid the expensive step of sorting the negative samples according to their individual scores. The third approach approximates the AP loss over all samples by the AP loss over difficult samples (for example, those that are incorrectly classified by a binary SVM), while ensuring the correct classification of the remaining samples. Using the PASCAL VOC action classification and object detection datasets, we show that our approaches provide significant speed-ups during training without degrading the test accuracy of AP-SVM.",,Classification (of information); Computational complexity; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Information science; Accuracy of information; Action classifications; Convex upper bound; Individual scores; Negative samples; Problem structure; Retrieval systems; Training data sets; Search engines,,Cortes C.Ghahramani Z.Welling M.Weinberger K.Q.Lawrence N.D.,Neural information processing systems foundation,10495258,,,,English,Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937889162

While there has been much work on designing algorithms for such performance measures, there is limited understanding of the theoretical properties of these algorithms. Recently, Ye et al. (2012) showed consistency results for two algorithms that optimize the F-measure, but their results apply only to an idealized setting, where precise knowledge of the underlying probability distribution (in the form of the 'true' posterior class probability) is available to a learning algorithm. In this work, we consider plug-in algorithms that learn a classifier by applying an empirically determined threshold to a suitable 'estimate' of the class probability, and provide a general methodology to show consistency of these methods for any non-decomposable measure that can be expressed as a continuous function of true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR), and for which the Bayes optimal classifier is the class probability function thresholded suitably. We use this template to derive consistency results for plug-in algorithms for the F-measure and for the geometric mean of TPR and precision; to our knowledge, these are the first such results for these measures. In addition, for continuous distributions, we show consistency of plug-in algorithms for any performance measure that is a continuous and monotonically increasing function of TPR and TNR.

Theoretically, unconstrained SFM can be performed in polynomial time [10, 11]. However, these algorithms are typically not practical. In 1976, Wolfe [21] proposed an algorithm to find the minimum Euclidean norm point in a polytope, and in 1980, Fujishige [3] showed how Wolfe's algorithm can be used for SFM. For general submodular functions, this Fujishige-Wolfe minimum norm algorithm seems to have the best empirical performance. Despite its good practical performance, very little is known about Wolfe's minimum norm algorithm theoretically. To our knowledge, the only result is an exponential time analysis due to Wolfe [21] himself. In this paper we give a maiden convergence analysis of Wolfe's algorithm. We prove that in t iterations, Wolfe's algorithm returns an O(1/t)-approximate solution to the min-norm point on any polytope. We also prove a robust version of Fujishige's theorem which shows that an O(1/n2)-approximate solution to the min-norm point on the base polytope implies exact submodular minimization.

In spite of this non-convexity, we establish exact recovery of the low-rank matrix, under the same conditions that are required by existing methods (which are based on convex optimization). For an m ×n input matrix(m ≤ n), our method has a running time of O (r2mn) per iteration, and needs O (log(1/ε)) iterations to reach an accuracy of ε. This is close to the running times of simple PCA via the power method, which requires O (rmn) per iteration, and O (log(1/ε)) iterations. In contrast, the existing methods for robust PCA, which are based on convex optimization, have O (m2n) complexity per iteration, and take O (1/ε) iterations, i.e., exponentially more iterations for the same accuracy.

First order probabilistic models combine the power of logic and probability to deal with such domains. A naive approach to inference in these models is to propositionalize the whole theory and carry out the inference on the ground network. Lifted inference techniques (such as lifted belief propagation; Singla and Domin- gos 2008) provide a more scalable approach to inference by combining together groups of objects which behave identically. In many cases, constructing the lifted network can itself be quite costly. In addition, the exact lifted network is often very close in size to the fully propositionalized model. To overcome these problems, we present approximate lifted inference, which groups together similar but distinguishable objects and treats them as if they were identical. Early stopping terminates the execution of the lifted network construction at an early stage resulting in a coarser network. Noise- tolerant hypercubes allow for marginal errors in the representation of the lifted network itself. Both of our algorithms can significantly speed up the process of lifted network construction as well as result in much smaller models. The coarseness of the approximation can be adjusted depending on the accuracy required, and we can bound the resulting error. Extensive evaluation on six domains demonstrates great efficiency gains with only minor (or no) loss in accuracy.

In this setting, each choice is a node of a graph and the expected payoffs of the neighboring nodes are assumed to be similar. Although the setting has application both in recommender systems and advertising, the traditional algorithms would scale poorly with the number of choices. For that purpose we consider an effective dimension d, which is small in real-world graphs. We deliver the analysis showing that the regret of SpectralTS scales as d√T InN with high probability, where T is the time horizon and N is the number of choices.

Prior work in this area scaled only to small problems in practice, or failed to provide strong theoretical guarantees, or employed a computationally-expensive most-probable-explanation (MPE) queries that assumes prior knowledge of a factored representation of the weight distribution. We identify a novel parameter, tilt, which is the ratio of the maximum weight of satisfying assignment to minimum weight of satisfying assignment and present a novel approach that works with a black-box oracle for weights of assignments and requires only an NP-oracle (in practice, a SAT-solver) to solve both the counting and sampling problems when the tilt is small. Our approach provides strong theoretical guarantees, and scales to problems involving several thousand variables.

By instantiating the backdoor variables one reduces the given instance to several easy instances that belong to a tractable class. The overall time needed to solve the instance is exponential in the size of the backdoor set, hence it is a challenging problem to find a small backdoor set if one exists; over the last years this problem has been subject of intensive research. In this paper we extend the classical notion of a strong backdoor set by allowing that different instantiations of the backdoor variables result in instances that belong to different base classes; the union of the base classes forms a heterogeneous base class. Backdoor sets to heterogeneous base classes can be much smaller than backdoor sets to homogeneous ones, hence they are much more desirable but possibly harder to find.We draw a detailed complexity landscape for the problem of detecting strong backdoor sets into heterogeneous base classes for SAT and CSF. We provide algorithms that establish fixed- parameter tractability under natural parameterizations, and we contrast the tractability results with hardness results that pinpoint the theoretical limits.Our results apply to the current state-of-the-art of tractable classes of CSP and SAT that are definable by restricting the constraint language.

It has broad applications like fraud detection, credit approval, computer network intrusion detection, anti-money laundering, etc. The basis of outlier detection is to identify data points which are ""different"" or ""far away"" from the rest of the data points in the given dataset. Traditional outlier detection method is based on statistical analysis. However, this traditional method has an inherent drawback-it requires the availability of the entire dataset. In practice, especially in the real time data feed application, it is not so realistic to wait for all the data because fresh data are streaming in very quickly. Outlier detection is hence done in batches. However two drawbacks may arise: relatively long processing time because of the massive size, and the result may be outdated soon between successive updates. In this paper, we propose several novel incremental methods to process the real time data effectively for outlier detection. For the experiment, we test three types of mechanisms for analyzing the dataset, namely Global Analysis, Cumulative Analysis and Lightweight Analysis with Sliding Window. The experiment dataset is ""household power consumption"" which is a popular benchmarking data for Massive Online Analysis.",Data stream mining; Incremental processing; Outlier detection,Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Electronic data interchange; Experiments; Intrusion detection; Statistical tests; Statistics; Anti-money laundering; Benchmarking data; Broad application; Data stream mining; Incremental method; Incremental processing; Network intrusion detection; Outlier Detection; Data mining,"Fong, S.; Department of Computer and Information Science, University of MacauMacau; email: ccfong@umac.mo",,Acta Press,,,,,English,"Proc.

In real-time applications the classical and modern ciphers are not appropriate because of vast quantity of data. However, certain applications like Pay-TV or Payable Internet Imaging Albums do not require entire part of an encryption, but requires a part of the image to be transparent to all users. Partial encryption is an approach to encode only the most essential portion of the data in order to afford a proportional confidentiality and to trim down the computational requirements and also execution time for encryption is reduced. In this paper, partial image encryption of color images using pixel position manipulation technique based on region of interest is proposed. It offers the amenities of partial encryption and reconstructs the images partially. Here input image is divided into sub blocks, and then selected blocks are encrypted using the proposed technique.

LMF algorithm exhibits lower steady state error than the conventional LMS algorithm. This is due to the fact that the excess mean-square error of the LMS algorithm is dependent only on the second order moment of the noise. The second order moment, or variance of the noise evaluates to be the same for all the noise environments. Based upon this other types of mean fourth based algorithms are implemented. These are Normalized LMF (NLMF) and Error Normalized LMF (ENLMF). In order to increase the stability of the filter leakage factor is introduced. Based on these considerations Normalized Leaky LMF (NLLMF) and Error Normalized Leaky LMF (ENLLMF) adaptive cancellers are developed for cardiac signal enhancement. Different filter structures are presented to eliminate the 60 Hz power line interference from the ECG signal. Finally, we have applied this algorithm on ECG signals from the MIT-BIH data base and compared its performance with the conventional LMS algorithm.

More interestingly, this allows generating fresh practice problems that have given solution characteristics by performing a backward search in UPG. We obtained around 300 natural deduction problems from various textbooks. Our solution generation procedure can solve many more problems than the traditional forward-chaining based procedure, while our problem generation procedure can efficiently generate several variants with desired characteristics.",,Computer-aided education; Core components; Enabling technologies; Inference rules; Natural deduction; Problems and Solutions; Solution characteristics; Type arguments; Computer aided instruction; Problem solving,IIT KanpurIndia,,,10450823,9781577356332,,,English,IJCAI Int.

Having incomplete observations is characteristic of offline networks used to model the spread of wildlife. We develop an EM algorithm to address parameter learning in such settings.

For example, by viewing and/or hearing traffic one could identify the state of traffic on the road. In this paper, we demonstrate a fusion based learning approach to classify the traffic states using low cost audio and image data analysis using real world dataset. Road side collected traffic acoustic signals and traffic image snapshots obtained from fixed camera are used to classify the traffic condition into three broad classes viz., Jam, Medium and Free. The classification is done on {10sec audio, image snapshot in that 10sec} data tuple. We extract traffic relevant features from audio and image data to form a composite feature vector. In particular, we extract the audio features comprising MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) classifier based features, honk events and energy peaks. A simple heuristic based image classifier is used, where vehicular density and number of corner points within the road segment are estimated and are used as features for traffic sensing. Finally the composite vector is tested for its ability to discriminate the traffic classes using Decision tree classifier, SVM classifier, Discriminant classifier and Logistic regression based classifier. Information fusion at multiple levels (audio, image, overall) shows consistently better performance than individual level decision making. Low cost sensor fusion based on complementary weak classifiers and noisy features still generates high quality results with an overall accuracy of 93 - 96%.",,Composite features; Decision tree classifiers; Discriminant classifiers; Image data analysis; Information signals; Logistic regressions; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; Public transportation; Artificial intelligence; Audition; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Decision trees; Face recognition; Information fusion; Roads and streets; Sensors; Speech recognition; Image segmentation,IBM India Research LabsIndia,,,10450823,9781577356332,,,English,IJCAI Int.

To compensate for the increased variability in supply and demand, we need algorithms for online energy resource allocation under temporal uncertainty of future consumption and availability. Recent advances in prediction algorithms offer hope that a reduction in future uncertainty, through short term predictions, will increase the worth of the renewables. Predictive information is then revealed incrementally in an online manner, leading to what we call dynamic temporal uncertainty. We demonstrate the non-triviality of this problem and provide online algorithms, both randomized and deterministic, to handle time varying uncertainty in future rewards for non-stationary MDPs in general and for energy resource allocation in particular.

In domains such as natural images, the data comes from very complex distributions which are hard to capture. Feature learning intends to discover or best approximate these underlying distributions and use their knowledge to weed out irrelevant information, preserving most of the relevant information. Feature learning can thus be seen as a form of dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we describe a feature learning scheme for natural images. We hypothesize that image patches do not all come from the same distribution, they lie in multiple non-linear subspaces. We propose a framework that uses K Restricted Boltzmann Machines (K-RBMs) to learn multiple non-linear subspaces in the raw image space. Projections of the image patches into these subspaces gives us features, which we use to build image representations. Our algorithm solves the coupled problem of finding the right non-linear subspaces in the input space and associating image patches with those subspaces in an iterative EM like algorithm to minimize the overall reconstruction error.

In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective method to do so. We address this problem by learning parts incrementally, starting from a single part occurrence with an Exemplar SVM. In this manner, additional part instances are discovered and aligned reliably before being considered as training examples. We also propose entropy-rank curves as a means of evaluating the distinctiveness of parts shareable between categories and use them to select useful parts out of a set of candidates. We apply the new representation to the task of scene categorisation on the MIT Scene 67 benchmark.

Various factors such as bone growth, ethnicity and dietary habits influence the facial aging pattern. This increases the difficulty in performing automated face recognition. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that improves the performance of face recognition by applying the bacteria foraging fusion algorithm. The proposed algorithm mitigates the effect of facial changes caused due to aging by combining the LBP features of global and local facial regions at match score level, by means of the bacteria foraging fusion algorithm. Experimental results are presented using the FG-Net and IIITDelhi face aging databases. The IIITDelhi database, which has been collected by the authors, consists of over 2600 age-separated labeled face images of 102 individuals.

It has a fast on-chip memory with data-access rates similar to the DSP's processing rate but it is not large enough to hold the entire Image data. Image buffers typically reside in the larger external memory like DDR whose data access rate is ~4-6X slower than the processor rate. Cache or direct memory access (DMA) mechanisms are used to improve the slow access rate of external memory using the internal memory. Optimizing an embedded processing application to be efficient for such hierarchical memory systems requires block-based algorithm design. This is usually accomplished by manually re-designing the code. This effort requires several man months and DSP expertise. In this paper, we automate this process and demonstrate a performance improvement of ~2-4X over conventional frame level processing. We believe that the proposed solution is novel in the sense that it is fully automated and scalable to any memory size and speed. We use a compiler assisted parser to extract the relevant function parameters and use them to re-target the code to be block-based and handle memory management automatically.

Mining object categories in these unannotated datasets is an important and useful step to extract meaningful information. Often the location and spatial extent of an object in an image is unknown. Mining objects in such a setting is hard. Recent methods model this problem as learning a separate classifier for each category. This is computationally expensive since a large number of classifiers are required to be trained and evaluated, before one can mine a concise set of meaningful objects. On the other hand, fast and efficient solutions have been proposed for the retrieval of instances (same object) from large databases. We borrow, from instance retrieval pipeline, its strengths and adapt it to speed up category mining. For this, we explore objects which are 'near-instances'. We mine several near-instance object categories from images.

A natural approach to performing inference over these programs is to execute them and compute statistics over the resulting samples. Indeed, this approach has been taken before in a number of probabilistic programming tools. In this paper, we address two key challenges of this paradigm: (i) ensuring samples are well distributed in the combinatorial space of the program, and (ii) efficiently generating samples with minimal rejection. We present a new sampling algorithm Qi that addresses these challenges using concepts from the field of program analysis. To solve the first challenge (getting diverse samples), we use a technique called symbolic execution to systematically explore all the paths in a program. In the case of programs with loops, we systematically explore all paths up to a given depth, and present theorems on error bounds on the estimates as a function of the path bounds used. To solve the second challenge (efficient samples with minimal rejection), we propagate observations backward through the program using the notion of Dijkstra's weakest preconditions and hoist these propagated conditions to condition elementary distributions during sampling. We present theorems explaining the mathematical properties of Qi, as well as empirical results from an implementation of the algorithm.

It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have comparable or better empirical performance compared to the state of the art methods. In this paper, we provide a novel regret analysis for Thompson Sampling that proves the first near-optimal problem-independent bound of O(√NT ln T) on the expected regret of this algorithm. Our novel martingale-based analysis techniques are conceptually simple, and easily extend to distributions other than the Beta distribution. For the version of Thompson Sampling that uses Gaussian priors, we prove a problem-independent bound of O(√NT lnN) on the expected regret, and demonstrate the optimality of this bound by providing a matching lower bound. This lower bound of Ω(√NT lnN) is the first lower bound on the performance of a natural version of Thompson Sampling that is away from the general lower bound of O(√NT) for the multi-armed bandit problem. Our near-optimal problem-independent bounds for Thompson Sampling solve a COLT 2012 open problem of Chapelle and Li. Additionally, our techniques simultaneously provide the optimal problem-dependent bound of (1+ε)Σiln T/d(μi,μ1) +O(Nε2 ) on the expected regret.

A dominant theoretical and algorithmic framework for AUC optimization/bipartite ranking has been to reduce the problem to pairwise classification; in particular, it is well known that the AUC regret can be formulated as a pairwise classification regret, which in turn can be upper bounded using usual regret bounds for binary classification. Recently, Kotlowski et al. (2011) showed AUC regret bounds in terms of the regret associated with 'balanced' versions of the standard (non-pairwise) logistic and exponential losses. In this paper, we obtain such (non-pairwise) surrogate regret bounds for the AUC in terms of a broad class of proper (composite) losses that we term strongly proper. Our proof technique is considerably simpler than that of Kotlowski et al. (2011), and relies on properties of proper (composite) losses as elucidated recently by Reid and Williamson (2009, 2010, 2011) and others. Our result yields explicit surrogate bounds (with no hidden balancing terms) in terms of a variety of strongly proper losses, including for example logistic, exponential, squared and squared hinge losses. An important consequence is that standard algorithms minimizing a (non-pairwise) strongly proper loss, such as logistic regression and boosting algorithms (assuming a universal function class and appropriate regularization), are in fact AUC-consistent; moreover, our results allow us to quantify the AUC regret in terms of the corresponding surrogate regret. We also obtain tighter surrogate regret bounds under certain low-noise conditions via a recent result of Clémençon and Robbiano (2011). © 2013 S.

LDA though successful in detecting prominent concerns, fails to detect many useful CCCs including ones that may be heavily executed but elude discovery because they do not have a strong prevalence in source-code. We pose this problem as that of discovering topics that rarely occur in individual documents, which we will refer to as subtle topics. Recently an interesting approach, namely focused topic models(FTM) was proposed in(Williamson et ah, 2010) for detecting rare topics. FTM, though successful in detecting topics which occur prominently in very few documents, is unable to detect subtle topics. Discovering subtle topics thus remains an important open problem. To address this issue we propose subtle topic models(STM). STM uses a generalized stick breaking process(GSBP) as a prior for defining multiple distributions over topics. This hierarchical structure on topics allows STM to discover rare topics beyond the capabilities of FTM. The associated inference is non-standard and is solved by exploiting the relationship between GSBP and generalized Dirichlet distribution. Empirical results show that STM is able to discover subtle CCC in two benchmark code-bases, a feat which is beyond the scope of existing topic models, thus demonstrating the potential of the model in automated concern discovery, a known difficult problem in Software Engineering. Furthermore it is observed that even in general text corpora STM outperforms the state of art in discovering subtle topics.

It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have better empirical performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. However, many questions regarding its theoretical performance remained open. In this paper, we design and analyze a generalization of Thompson Sampling algorithm for the stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit problem with linear payoff functions, when the contexts are provided by an adaptive adversary. This is among the most important and widely studied version of the contextual bandits problem. We prove a high probability regret bound of Õ(d 2/ε√T1+ε) in time T for any 0 &lt; ε &lt; 1, where d is the dimension of each context vector and ε is a parameter used by the algorithm. Our results provide the first theoretical guarantees for the contextual version of Thompson Sampling, and are close to the lower bound of Ω(d√T) for this problem.

We develop routines for optimizing over the space of tree-structured features and efficiently scale to problems with more than half a million training points.

However, despite the large number of studies on this problem, little is understood about the statistical consistency of the algorithms proposed with respect to the performance measures of interest. In this paper, we study consistency with respect to one such performance measure, namely the arithmetic mean of the true positive and true negative rates (AM), and establish that some practically popular approaches, such as applying an empirically determined threshold to a suitable class probability estimate or performing an empirically balanced form of risk minimization, are in fact consistent with respect to the AM (under mild conditions on the underlying distribution).

As mentioned in Chaudhuri et al. (2011), the problem seems to be intractable for general kernel functions in the standard learning model of releasing different private predictor. We study this problem in three simpler but practical settings. We first study an interactive model where the user sends its test points to a trusted learner (like search engines) and expects accurate but differentially private predictions. In the second model, the learner has access to a subset of the unlabeled test set using which it releases a predictor, which preserves privacy of the training data. (NIH, 2003) is an example of such publicly available test set. Our third model is similar to the traditional model, where learner is oblivious to the test set but the kernels are restricted to functions over vector spaces. For each of the models, we derive differentially private learning algorithms with provable ""utility"" or error bounds. Moreover, we show that our methods can also be applied to the traditional model where they demonstrate better dimensionality dependence when compared to the methods of (Rubinstein et ah, 2009; Chaudhuri et al., 2011).

This is an important problem for signal acquisition and has several learning applications as well, e.g., multi-label classification (Hsu et ah, 2009). We study this problem in two settings: a) support recovery: recover the support of x*, b) approximate vector recovery: recover a unit vector x such that ||x - x*||2 ≤ e. For support recovery, we propose two novel and efficient solutions based on two combinatorial structures: union free families of sets and expanders. In contrast to existing methods for support recovery, our methods are universal i.e. a single measurement matrix A can recover all the signals. For approximate recovery, we propose the first method to recover a sparse vector using a near optimal number of measurements. We also empirically validate our algorithms and demonstrate that our algorithms recover the true signal using fewer measurements than the existing methods.

Increasingly, however, in several applications, ranging from ranking and biometric screening to medical diagnosis, performance is measured not in terms of the full area under the ROC curve, but instead, in terms of the partial area under the ROC curve between two specified false positive rates. In this paper, we develop a structural SVM framework for directly optimizing the partial AUC between any two false positive rates. Our approach makes use of a cutting plane solver along the lines of the structural SVM based approach for optimizing the full AUC developed by Joachims (2005). Unlike the full AUC, where the combinatorial optimization problem needed to find the most violated constraint in the cutting plane solver can be decomposed easily to yield an efficient algorithm, the corresponding optimization problem in the case of partial AUC is harder to decompose. One of our key technical contributions is an efficient algorithm for solving this combinatorial optimization problem that has the same computational complexity as Joachims' algorithm for optimizing the usual AUC. This allows us to efficiently optimize the partial AUC in any desired false positive range. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of real-world tasks.

While smart monitoring and control of appliances can reduce the overall energy consumption, management and cost associated with such systems act as a big hindrance. Prior work has established that detailed feedback in the form of appliance level consumption to building occupants improves their awareness and paves the way for reduction in electricity consumption. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), i.e. the process of disaggregating the overall home electricity usage measured at the meter level into constituent appliances, provides a simple and cost effective methodology to provide such feedback to the occupants.

We have used multiclass support vector machine classifier for classification of objects. The proposed method has been tested on dataset prepared by authors of this paper. We have tested the proposed method on multiple levels of Dual tree complex wavelet transform. Quantitative evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method gives better performance for multiclass object classification in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2013 IEEE.",Dual tree complex wavelet transform; Feature selection; Multiclass object classification,Feature extraction; Forestry; Learning systems; Better performance; Computer vision applications; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; Multi-class support vector machines; Object classification; Quantitative evaluation; Shift invariant; State-of-the-art methods; Classification (of information),,,IEEE Computer Society,,,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Extant program assessment systems score mostly based on the number of test-cases passed, providing no insight into the competency of the programmer. In this paper, we present a machine learning framework to automatically grade computer programs. We propose a set of highly-informative features, derived from the abstract representations of a given program, that capture the program's functionality. These features are then used to learn a model to grade the programs, which are built against evaluations done by experts on the basis of a rubric. We show that regression modeling based on the given features provide much better grading than the ubiquitous test-case-pass based grading and rivals the grading accuracy of other open-response problems such as essay grading. We also show that our novel features add significant value over and above basic keyword/expression count features. In addition to this, we propose a novel way of posing computer-program grading as a one-class modeling problem. Our preliminary investigations in the same show promising results and suggest an implicit correlation of our features with the proposed grading-levels (rubric). To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time machine learning has been applied to the problem of grading programs.

We first define and quantify translation difficulty in terms of TDI. We realize that any measure of TDI based on direct input by translators is fraught with subjectivity and adhocism. We, rather, rely on cognitive evidences from eye tracking. TDI is measured as the sum of fixation (gaze) and saccade (rapid eye movement) times of the eye. We then establish that TDI is correlated with three properties of the input sentence, viz. length (L), degree of polysemy (DP) and structural complexity (SC). We train a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system to predict TDIs for new sentences using these features as input. The prediction done by our framework is well correlated with the empirical gold standard data, which is a repository of < L, DP, SC > and TDI pairs for a set of sentences. The primary use of our work is a way of ""binning"" sentences (to be translated) in ""easy"", ""medium"" and ""hard"" categories as per their predicted TDI. This can decide pricing of any translation task, especially useful in a scenario where parallel corpora for Machine Translation are built through translation crowdsourcing/outsourcing.

We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews, especially in the camera domain. An ontology of the camera domain is created. Thwarting is looked upon as the phenomenon of polarity reversal at a higher level of ontology compared to the polarity expressed at the lower level. This notion of thwarting defined with respect to an ontology is novel, to the best of our knowledge. A rule based implementation building upon this idea forms our baseline. We show that machine learning with annotated corpora (thwarted/non-thwarted) is more effective than the rule based system.

Here, p-dimensional samples are presented sequentially, and the goal is to produce the κ-dimensional subspace that best approximates these points. Standard algorithms require O(p2) memory; meanwhile no algorithm can do better than O(κp) memory, since this is what the output itself requires. Memory (or storage) complexity is most meaningful when understood in the context of computational and sample complexity. Sample complexity for high-dimensional PCA is typically studied in the setting of the spiked covariance model, where p-dimensional points are generated from a population covariance equal to the identity (white noise) plus a low-dimensional perturbation (the spike) which is the signal to be recovered. It is now well-understood that the spike can be recovered when the number of samples, n, scales proportionally with the dimension, p. Yet, all algorithms that provably achieve this, have memory complexity O(p2). Meanwhile, algorithms with memory-complexity O(κp) do not have provable bounds on sample complexity comparable to p. We present an algorithm that achieves both: it uses O(κp) memory (meaning storage of any kind) and is able to compute the k-dimensional spike with O(p log p) samplecomplexity - the first algorithm of its kind.

However, not much is known about other directions. Formally, these relationships involve regret transfer bounds. In this paper, we introduce the notion of weak regret transfer bounds, where the mapping needed to transform a model from one problem to another depends on the underlying probability distribution (and in practice, must be estimated from data).

Over the last two decades, a popular generic empirical approach to the many variants of this problem has been one of alternating minimization; i.e. alternating between estimating the missing phase information, and the candidate solution. In this paper, we show that a simple alternating minimization algorithm geometrically converges to the solution of one such problem - finding a vector x from y,A, where y = |AT x| and |z| denotes a vector of element-wise magnitudes of z - under the assumption that A is Gaussian. Empirically, our algorithm performs similar to recently proposed convex techniques for this variant (which are based on ""lifting"" to a convex matrix problem) in sample complexity and robustness to noise. However, our algorithm is much more efficient and can scale to large problems. Analytically, we show geometric convergence to the solution, and sample complexity that is off by log factors from obvious lower bounds. We also establish close to optimal scaling for the case when the unknown vector is sparse. Our work represents the only known theoretical guarantee for alternating minimization for any variant of phase retrieval problems in the non-convex setting.",,Algorithms; Phase shifters; Alternating minimization; Alternating minimization algorithms; Empirical approach; Phase information; Phase retrieval; Robustness to noise; Sample complexity; Theoretical guarantees; Problem solving,,,Neural information processing systems foundation,10495258,,,,English,Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898994174

However, these approaches can be classified as weak AI systems. According to the classical definition, a strong AI based WSD system should perform the task of sense disambiguation in the same manner and with similar accuracy as human beings. In order to accomplish this, a detailed understanding of the human techniques employed for sense disambiguation is necessary. Instead of building yet another WSD system that uses contextual evidence for sense disambiguation, as has been done before, we have taken a step back-we have endeavored to discover the cognitive faculties that lie at the very core of the human sense disambiguation technique. In this paper, we present a hypothesis regarding the cognitive sub-processes involved in the task of WSD.We support our hypothesis using the experiments conducted through the means of an eye-tracking device. We also strive to find the levels of difficulties in annotating various classes of words, with senses.

This model learns the cost of putting a word immediately before another word and finds the best reordering by solving an instance of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, for efficiently solving the TSP, the model is restricted to pairwise features which examine only a pair of words and their neighborhood. In this work, we go beyond these pairwise features and learn a model to rerank the n-best reorderings produced by the TSP model using higher order and structural features which help in capturing longer range dependencies. In addition to using a more informative set of source side features, we also capture target side features indirectly by using the translation score assigned to a reordering.

Since the wavelet functions are isotropic in every scale and have limited directional capabilities, the denoising performance obtained by minimizing PURE is poor around the discontinuities in the images. To overcome these limitations, we extend PURE to the Haar directionlet domain.

In this study we discuss video mechanism in which information can be hidden directly by modifying intensity values or frequency components of an image. Intensity values of an image can be modified directly, for modifying frequency components image need to transform image using different transformation techniques. Important properties of watermark include imperceptibility and robustness. Singular values of an image have very good stability when small values are added to the image, it does not effect the quality with great variation. Singular values correspond to intensity and singular vectors represent geometric characteristics. Here we made a study of hiding information using different hybrid watermarking techniques, SVD with DWT, RDWT,CWT at various levels of transformations in low, high, mid bands of frequencies. The quality of watermarked data and extracted watermark is calculated using PSNR and NCC by applying various attacks. Depending on the level of transformation and band in which watermark is embedded for some attacks the image was robust and for some it was not. Information can also be hidden in R G B or Y U V color spaces.

The key idea in compressed sensing for multilabel classification is to first project the label vector to a lower dimensional space using a random transformation and then learn regression functions over these projections. Our approach considers both of these components in a single probabilistic model, thereby jointly optimizing over compression as well as learning tasks. We then derive an efficient variational inference scheme that provides joint posterior distribution over all the unobserved labels. The two key benefits of the model are that a) it can naturally handle datasets that have missing labels and b) it can also measure uncertainty in prediction. The uncertainty estimate provided by the model allows for active learning paradigms where an oracle provides information about labels that promise to be maximally informative for the prediction task. Our experiments show significant boost over prior methods in terms of prediction performance over benchmark datasets, both in the fully labeled and the missing labels case. Finally, we also highlight various useful active learning scenarios that are enabled by the probabilistic model.",,Bayesian compressed sensing; Bayesian frameworks; Multi-label classifications; Posterior distributions; Prediction performance; Probabilistic models; Uncertainty estimates; Variational inference; Benchmarking; Forecasting; Uncertainty analysis; Vector spaces; Signal reconstruction,"Microsoft Research, Redmond, United States",,,10495258,9781627480031,,,English,Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877734258

This model is based on the saliency hypothesis for tracking which postulates that tracking is achieved by the top-down tuning, based on target features, of discriminant center-surround saliency mechanisms over time. In this work, we identify three main predictions that must hold if the hypothesis were true: 1) tracking reliability should be larger for salient than for non-salient targets, 2) tracking reliability should have a dependence on the defining variables of saliency, namely feature contrast and distractor heterogeneity, and must replicate the dependence of saliency on these variables, and 3) saliency and tracking can be implemented with common low level neural mechanisms. We confirm that the first two predictions hold by reporting results from a set of human behavior studies on the connection between saliency and tracking. We also show that the third prediction holds by constructing a common neurophysiologically plausible architecture that can computationally solve both saliency and tracking. This architecture is fully compliant with the standard physiological models of V1 and MT, and with what is known about attentional control in area LIP, while explaining the results of the human behavior experiments.",,Feature contrasts; Human behaviors; Neural mechanisms; Target feature; Topdown; Visual Tracking; Forecasting; Physiological models; Social sciences; Target tracking,"Yahoo Labs, Bangalore, India",,,10495258,9781627480031,,,English,Adv. neural inf. proces. syst.,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877768295

In this paper we establish that the Lovász v function is equivalent to a kernel learning problem related to one class SVM. This interesting connection opens up many opportunities bridging graph theoretic algorithms and machine learning. We show that there exist graphs, which we call SVM - v graphs, on which the Lovász v function can be approximated well by a one-class SVM. This leads to novel use of SVM techniques for solving algorithmic problems in large graphs e.g. identifying a planted clique of size Θ( √n) in a random graph G(n; 1/2 ). A classic approach for this problem involves computing the v function, however it is not scalable due to SDP computation. We show that the random graph with a -planted clique is an example of SVM - v graph. As a consequence a SVM based approach easily identifies the clique in large graphs and is competitive with the state-of-the-art. We introduce the notion of common orthogonal labelling and show that it can be computed by solving a Multiple Kernel learning problem. It is further shown that such a labelling is extremely useful in identifying a large common dense subgraph in multiple graphs, which is known to be a computationally difficult problem.

Several local search algorithms are based on searching the k-exchange neighborhood. This is the set of solutions that can be obtained from the current solution by exchanging at most k elements. As a rule of thumb, the larger k is, the better are the chances of finding an improved solution. However, for inputs of size n, a naive brute-force search of the k-exchange neighborhood requires n O(k) time, which is not practical even for very small values of k. Fellows et al. (IJCAI 2009) studied whether this brute-force search is avoidable and gave positive and negative answers for several combinatorial problems. They used the notion of local search in a strict sense. That is, an improved solution needs to be found in the k-exchange neighborhood even if a global optimum can be found efficiently. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of local search, called permissive local search (Marx and Schlotter, IWPEC 2009) and investigate whether it enhances the domain of tractable inputs. We exemplify this approach on a fundamental combinatorial problem, VERTEX COVER. More precisely, we show that for a class of inputs, finding an optimum is hard, strict local search is hard, but permissive local search is tractable.

We believe that such a tool can be used by teachers in making examinations where they need to test students on problems similar to what they taught in class, and by students in generating practice problems tailored to their specific needs. Our first insight is that we can generalize p syntactically to a query Q that implicitly represents a set of problems [[Q]] (which includes p). Our second insight is that we can explore the space of problems [[Q]] automatically, use classical results from polynomial identity testing to generate only those problems in [[Q]] that are correct, and then use pruning techniques to generate only unique and interesting problems. Our third insight is that with a small amount of manual tuning on the query Q, the user can interactively guide the computer to generate problems of interest to her. We present the technical details of the above mentioned steps, and also describe a tool where these steps have been implemented. We also present an empirical evaluation on a wide variety of problems from various sub-fields of algebra including polynomials, trigonometry, calculus, determinants etc. Our tool is able to generate a rich corpus of similar problems from each given problem; while some of these similar problems were already present in the textbook, several were new!

Rules are assumed to be conjunctions of basic propositions concerning the values taken by the input features. It has been shown that rule ensembles for classification can be learnt optimally and efficiently using hierarchical kernel learning approaches that explore the exponentially large space of conjunctions by exploiting its hierarchical structure. The regularizer employed penalizes large features and thereby selects a small set of short features. In this paper, we generalize the rule ensemble learning using hierarchical kernels (RELHKL) framework to multi class structured output spaces. We build on the StructSVM model for sequence prediction problems and employ a ρ-norm hierarchical regularizer for observation features and a conventional 2-norm regularizer for state transition features. The exponentially large feature space is searched using an active set algorithm and the exponentially large set of constraints are handled using a cutting plane algorithm. The approach can be easily extended to other structured output problems. We perform experiments on activity recognition datasets which are prone to noise, sparseness and skewness. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms other approaches. Copyright © 2012, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We show how these relative attribute predictions enable a variety of novel applications, including zero-shot learning from relative comparisons, automatic image description, image search with interactive feedback, and active learning of discriminative classifiers. We overview results demonstrating these applications with images of faces and natural scenes.

Previous attempts for this task mostly rely on visual clues and corpus statistics, but do not take much advantage of the semantic information inherent in the available image descriptions. Here, we present a generic method which benefits from all these three sources (i.e. visual clues, corpus statistics and available descriptions) simultaneously, and is capable of constructing novel descriptions. Our approach works on syntactically and linguistically motivated phrases extracted from the human descriptions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our formulation mostly generates lucid and semantically correct descriptions, and significantly outperforms the previous methods on automatic evaluation metrics. One of the significant advantages of our approach is that we can generate multiple interesting descriptions for an image. Unlike any previous work, we also test the applicability of our method on a large dataset containing complex images with rich descriptions.

Most of the existing methods assume the extent to which the given tasks are related or share a common feature space to be known apriori. In real-world applications however, it is desirable to automatically discover the groups of related tasks that share a feature space. In this paper we aim at searching the exponentially large space of all possible groups of tasks that may share a feature space. The main contribution is a convex formulation that employs a graph-based regularizer and simultaneously discovers few groups of related tasks, having close-by task parameters, as well as the feature space shared within each group. The regularizer encodes an important structure among the groups of tasks leading to an efficient algorithm for solving it: if there is no feature space under which a group of tasks has close-by task parameters, then there does not exist such a feature space for any of its supersets. An efficient active set algorithm that exploits this simplification and performs a clever search in the exponentially large space is presented. The algorithm is guaranteed to solve the proposed formulation (within some precision) in a time polynomial in the number of groups of related tasks discovered. Empirical results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed formulation achieves good generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task learning algorithms in some cases.

Specifically K is modeled as a positive affine combination of given positive semi definite kernels, with the coefficients ranging in a norm-bounded uncertainty set. We treat the problem using the Robust Optimization methodology. This reduces the uncertain SVM problem into a deterministic conic quadratic problem which can be solved in principle by a polynomial time Interior Point (IP) algorithm. However, for large-scale classification problems, IP methods become intractable and one has to resort to first-order gradient type methods. The strategy we use here is to reformulate the robust counterpart of the uncertain SVM problem as a saddle point problem and employ a special gradient scheme which works directly on the convex-concave saddle function. The algorithm is a simplified version of a general scheme due to Juditski and Nemirovski (2011). It achieves an O(1/T 2) reduction of the initial error after T iterations. A comprehensive empirical study on both synthetic data and real-world protein structure data sets show that the proposed formulations achieve the desired robustness, and the saddle point based algorithm outperforms the IP method significantly. © 2012 Aharon Ben-Tal, Sahely Bhadra, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya and Arkadi Nemirovski.",Kernel functions; Robust optimization; Uncertain classification,Empirical studies; First-order; Gradient type; Interior point; Kernel function; Kernel matrices; Norm-bounded uncertainty; Polynomial-time; Protein structures; Quadratic problem; Robust classification; Robust optimization; Saddle functions; Saddle point; Saddle point problems; SVM classifiers; Synthetic data; Optimization; Polynomial approximation; Algorithms,"Ben-Tal, A.; William Davidson Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion- Israel Institute of Technology, Technion City, Haifa 32000, Israel; email: abental@ie.technion.ac.il",,,15324435,,,,English,J.

To this end we introduce a new annotated dataset of pets covering 37 different breeds of cats and dogs. The visual problem is very challenging as these animals, particularly cats, are very deformable and there can be quite subtle differences between the breeds. We make a number of contributions: first, we introduce a model to classify a pet breed automatically from an image. The model combines shape, captured by a deformable part model detecting the pet face, and appearance, captured by a bag-of-words model that describes the pet fur. Fitting the model involves automatically segmenting the animal in the image. Second, we compare two classification approaches: a hierarchical one, in which a pet is first assigned to the cat or dog family and then to a breed, and a flat one, in which the breed is obtained directly. We also investigate a number of animal and image orientated spatial layouts. These models are very good: they beat all previously published results on the challenging ASIRRA test (cat vs dog discrimination). When applied to the task of discriminating the 37 different breeds of pets, the models obtain an average accuracy of about 59%, a very encouraging result considering the difficulty of the problem. © 2012 IEEE.",,Bag-of-words models; Data sets; Fine grained; Object categorization; Spatial layout; Two classification; Animals; Computer vision; Information retrieval,"Parkhi, O.M.; Department of Engineering Science, University of OxfordUnited Kingdom; email: omkar@robots.ox.ac.uk",,,10636919,9781467312264,PIVRE,,English,Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866674414

This process becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the database increases. Filtering approaches use a light weight comparison to select a smaller set of candidate templates from the database for explicit comparison. However, most existing filtering schemes use specific features that are hand-crafted for the biometric trait at each stage of the filtering. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of weak features in a cascade for filtering fingerprint databases. We start with a set of potential indexing features computed from minutiae triplets and minutiae quadruplets. Each stage of filtering consists of projecting the probe onto a specific line and the removal of database samples outside a window around the probe. The critical problem in this process is the selection of lines for projection at each stage of the filtering. We show that by using a set of random lines and the proposed fitness function, one can achieve better results that optimization methods such as PCA or LDA. Experimental results show that using an ensemble of projections we can reduce the penetration to 26% at a hit rate of 99%. As each stage of the cascade is extremely fast, and filtering is progressive along the cascade, one can terminate the cascade at any point to achieve the desired performance. One can also combine this method with other indexing methods to improve the overall accuracy and speed. We present detailed experimental results on various aspects of the process on the FVC 2002 dataset. © 2012 IEEE.",,Biometric traits; Biometrie identification; Critical problems; Data sets; Filtering schemes; Fingerprint database; Fingerprint identification; Fitness functions; Hit rate; Indexing features; Indexing methods; Light weight; Optimization method; Random projections; Biometrics; Database systems; Indexing (of information); Probes; Computer vision,"Iqbal, A.; International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, 500032, India; email: atif.iqbal@research.iiit.ac.in",,,21607508,9781467316118,,,English,IEEE Comput.

These features are used to create an affine invariant local descriptor, called an arrangement vector, for each minutia. To account for missing and spurious minutiae, we consider subsets of the neighboring minutiae and hashes of these structures are used in the indexing process. The primary goal of the work is to explore the effectiveness of affine invariant features for representing local minutiae structures.

In many applications, however, graphs that arise have several local regions of interest, and the second eigenvector will typically fail to provide information fine-tuned to each local region. In this paper, we introduce a locally-biased analogue of the second eigenvector, and we demonstrate its usefulness at highlighting local properties of data graphs in a semi-supervised manner. To do so, we first view the second eigenvector as the solution to a constrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local information as an additional constraint; we then characterize the optimal solution to this new problem and show that it can be interpreted as a generalization of a Personalized PageRank vector; and finally, as a consequence, we show that the solution can be computed in nearly-linear time. In addition, we show that this locally-biased vector can be used to compute an approximation to the best partition near an input seed set in a manner analogous to the way in which the second eigenvector of the Laplacian can be used to obtain an approximation to the best partition in the entire input graph. Such a primitive is useful for identifying and refining clusters locally, as it allows us to focus on a local region of interest in a semi-supervised manner. Finally, we provide a detailed empirical evaluation of our method by showing how it can applied to finding locally-biased sparse cuts around an input vertex seed set in social and information networks. © 2012 Michael W.

However, most existing metric learning algorithms are limited to learning metrics over low-dimensional data, while existing kernel learning algorithms are often limited to the transductive setting and do not generalize to new data points. In this paper, we study the connections between metric learning and kernel learning that arise when studying metric learning as a linear transformation learning problem. In particular, we propose a general optimization framework for learning metrics via linear transformations, and analyze in detail a special case of our framework-that of minimizing the LogDet divergence subject to linear constraints. We then propose a general regularized framework for learning a kernel matrix, and show it to be equivalent to our metric learning framework. Our theoretical connections between metric and kernel learning have two main consequences: 1) the learned kernel matrix parameterizes a linear transformation kernel function and can be applied inductively to new data points, 2) our result yields a constructive method for kernelizing most existing Mahalanobis metric learning formulations. We demonstrate our learning approach by applying it to large-scale real world problems in computer vision, text mining and semi-supervised kernel dimensionality reduction. © 2012 Prateek Jain, Brian Kulis, Jason V.

Here different parties own different parts of a data set, and the goal is to learn a classifier from the entire data set without any party revealing any information about the individual data points it owns. Pathak et al [7] recently proposed a solution to this problem in which each party learns a local classifier from its own data, and a third party then aggregates these classifiers in a privacy-preserving manner using a cryptographic scheme. The generalization performance of their algorithm is sensitive to the number of parties and the relative fractions of data owned by the different parties. In this paper, we describe a new differentially private algorithm for the multiparty setting that uses a stochastic gradient descent based procedure to directly optimize the overall multiparty objective rather than combining classifiers learned from optimizing local objectives. The algorithm achieves a slightly weaker form of differential privacy than that of [7], but provides improved generalization guarantees that do not depend on the number of parties or the relative sizes of the individual data sets.

Many algorithms are now available for this well-studied problem. One of the earliest algorithms, given by W. R. Thompson, dates back to 1933. This algorithm, referred to as Thompson Sampling, is a natural Bayesian algorithm. The basic idea is to choose an arm to play according to its probability of being the best arm. Thompson Sampling algorithm has experimentally been shown to be close to optimal. In addition, it is efficient to implement and exhibits several desirable properties such as small regret for delayed feedback. However, theoretical understanding of this algorithm was quite limited. In this paper, for the first time, we show that Thompson Sampling algorithm achieves logarithmic expected regret for the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. More precisely, for the stochastic two-armed bandit problem, the expected regret in time T is O( ln T/Δ+ 1/Δ3 ). And, for the stochastic N-armed bandit problem, the expected regret in time T is O( [ ( ∑N i=2 1/Δ2i )2 ln T). Our bounds are optimal but for the dependence on Δi and the constant factors in big-Oh. © 2012 S. Agrawal &amp; N.

Online learning involves learning from data in real-time, due to which the learned model as well as its predictions are continuously changing. This makes preserving privacy of each data point significantly more challenging as its effect on the learned model can be easily tracked by observing changes in the subsequent predictions. Furthermore, with more and more online systems (e.g. search engines like Bing, Google etc.) trying to learn their customers' behavior by leveraging their access to sensitive customer data (through cookies etc.), the problem of privacy preserving online learning has become critical. We study the problem in the framework of online convex programming (OCP)-a popular online learning setting with several theoretical and practical implications-while using differential privacy as the formal measure of privacy. For this problem, we provide a generic framework that can be used to convert any given OCP algorithm into a private OCP algorithm with provable privacy as well as regret guarantees (utility), provided that the given OCP algorithm satisfies the following two criteria: 1) linearly decreasing sensitivity, i.e., the effect of the new data points on the learned model decreases linearly, 2) sub-linear regret. We then illustrate our approach by converting two popular OCP algorithms into corresponding differentially private algorithms while guaranteeing Õ ( √ T) regret for strongly convex functions. Next, we consider the practically important class of online linear regression problems, for which we generalize the approach by Dwork et al. (2010a) to provide a differentially private algorithm with just poly-log regret. Finally, we show that our online learning framework can be used to provide differentially private algorithms for the offline learning problem as well. For the offline learning problem, our approach guarantees better error bounds and is more practical than the existing state-of-the-art methods (Chaudhuri et al., 2011; Rubinstein et al., 2009). © 2012 P.

However, formal analyses (LOS14, ROC20) proposed in the spatial reasoning literature ignore many distinctions crucial to computer vision, as a result of which these algebras have been largely ignored in vision applications. Two distinctions of relevance to visual computation are (a) whether the occluder is a moving object or part of the static background, and (b) whether the visible part of an object is a connected blob or fragmented. In this work, we develop a formal model of occlusion states that combines these criteria with overlap distinctions modeled in spatial reasoning to come up with a comprehensive set of fourteen occlusion states, which we define as OCS14. Transitions between these occlusion states are an important source of information on visual activity (e.g. splits and merges). We show that the resulting formalism is representationally complete in the sense that these states constitute a partition of all possible occlusion situations based on these criteria. Finally, we show results from implementations of this approach in a test application involving static camera based scene analysis, where occlusion state analysis and multiple object tracking can be used for two tasks - (a) identifying static occluders, and (b) modeling a class of interactions represented as transitions of occlusion states. Thus, the formalism is shown to have direct relevance to actual vision applications.",,Formal analysis; Multiple object tracking; Spatial reasoning; Static background; Test applications; Vision applications; Visual activity; Visual computations; Artificial intelligence; Formal methods,"TCS Innovation Labs., New Delhi, India",,,10450823,9781577355120,,,English,IJCAI Int.

On the other hand, we believe that reasoning with detected/tracked face regions has a strong role in multiple face tracking. We propose a reasoning scheme that binds face localization (motion and mean-shift) and detection (Ada-Boost with Haar features) for tracking multiple faces in image sequences. The reasoning procedure identifies the cases of face isolation (unoccluded), grouping/occlusions, detection/tracking failure, entry/exit and reappearance of faces. Instantiation of these cases are used as cues in selective update of the facial features. Additionally, we maintain a Normalized Face Cluster Set (NFCS) to capture the appearance modes for varying facial poses. These cluster sets are further used in discriminating new faces from the existing ones while restoring the tracks of the later.

The algorithm employs a fuzzy metric to measure the dispersion of individual feature of a block with respect to that of the template. A fuzzy threshold, preset by the user, is employed to restrict less likely blocks from participation in the matching. A decision tree is used to test the feasibility of a block for matching with the template. The tree at each link examines the condition for fuzzy thresholding for one feature of the image. If the block satisfies the condition, it is passed on to the next level in the tree for testing its feasibility of matching with respect to the next feature. If it fails, the block is discarded from the search space, and the next block from the partitioned image is passed on for examination. The process goes on until all the blocks pass through the decision tree. If a suitable block satisfies all the test conditions in the decision tree, the block is declared as the solution for the matching problem. The ordering of features to be examined by the tree is performed here by an entropy measure as used in classical decision tree. The algorithm has successfully been implemented for template matching of human eyes in facial images carrying different emotions, and the classification accuracy is as high as 94%.",Decision tree; Entropy measure; Fuzzy threshold; Hierarchical search; Template matching,Classification accuracy; Entropy measure; Facial images; Fuzzy conditions; Fuzzy threshold; Fuzzy thresholding; Hierarchical algorithm; Hierarchical search; Human eye; Matching problems; Search spaces; Test condition; Algorithms; Computer vision; Decision trees; Entropy; Pixels; Template matching; Image matching,"Mandal, R.; Department of Electronics and Tele-Communication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Calcutta-32, India",,,,9781601321916,,,English,"Proc.

For that fused image local threshold is computed. This is followed by the second stage in which the initial points are determined by computation of global threshold.

A hybrid feature descriptor, which combines the advantages of SURF & Hu Moment Invariant methods, is used as a combined feature set to achieve a good recognition rate along with a low time complexity. To further increase the recognition rate and make the recognition system resilient to view-point variations, the concept of derived features from the available feature set is introduced. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for hybrid classification of single signed letter. In addition, finger spelled word recognition using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for a lexicon based approach is also proposed in this paper.

During training of the models, instead of performing MAP adaptation of the UBM, the model parameters of the GMM are estimated such that target scores are maximized while impostor scores are minimized. The focus of the algorithm is to estimate more accurately, the parameters of the elements of the mixture that are unique to a speaker. The algorithm uses an Expectation-Maximisation-like framework for estimation of parameters. It is shown that the algorithm converges with appropriate choice of a regularization parameter (α). α balances target and impostor data during each iteration of the algorithm. Fast convergence can be obtained by modifying the regularization parameter after each iteration. It is shown that incrementing α is a sufficient condition for convergence. Further, an impostor data selection technique for fast implementation is addressed. The performance of the system is evaluated on NIST 2003 benchmark dataset.

Sometimes, fingerprint images can have some noisy data while capturing them using slap fingerprint scanners. This noise causes improper slap fingerprint segmentation due to which the performance of fingerprint matching decreases. The process of eliminating duplicates is called de-duplication which requires the plain quality fingerprints. While doing the segmentation of slap fingerprints, some of the fingerprint images are improperly segmented because of the noise present in the data. In this paper, an attempt is made to remove the noise present in the slap fingerprint data using binarization of slap fingerprint image, and region labeling of desired regions with 8-adjacency neighborhood for accurate slap fingerprint segmentation.

Instead, we focus on the situation where there are two resource deprived languages, both having a very small amount of seed annotated data and a large amount of untagged data. We then use bilingual bootstrapping, wherein, a model trained using the seed annotated data of L 1 is used to annotate the untagged data of L 2 and vice versa using parameter projection. The untagged instances of L 1 and L 2 which get annotated with high confidence are then added to the seed data of the respective languages and the above process is repeated.

For this problem, we propose a novel partial hard-thresholding operator that leads to a general family of iterative algorithms. While one extreme of the family yields well known hard thresholding algorithms like ITI and HTP[17,10], the other end of the spectrum leads to a novel algorithm that we call Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement (OMPR).OMPR, like the classic greedy algorithm OMP, adds exactly one coordinate to the support at each iteration, based on the correlation with the current residual. However, unlike OMP,OMPR also removes one coordinate from the support. This simple change allows us to prove that OMPR has the best known guarantees for sparse recovery in terms of the Restricted Isometry Property (a condition on the measurement matrix). In contrast, OMP is known to have very weak performance guarantees under RIP. Given its simple structure, we are able to extend OMPR using locality sensitive hashing to get OMPR-Hash, the first provably sub-linear (in dimensionality) algorithm for sparse recovery. Our proof techniques are novel and flexible enough to also permit the tightest known analysis of popular iterative algorithms such as CoSaMP and Subspace Pursuit. We provide experimental results on large problems providing recovery for vectors of size up to million dimensions. We demonstrate that for large-scale problems our proposed methods are more robust and faster than existing methods.",,Compressive sensing; Greedy algorithms; Hard thresholding; Iterative algorithm; Large-scale problem; Linear measurements; Locality sensitive hashing; Measurement matrix; Novel algorithm; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Performance guarantees; Simple structures; Sparse recovery; Sparse vectors; Iterative methods; Matrix algebra; Recovery; Algorithms,"Jain, P.; Microsoft Research India, Bangalore, India; email: prajain@microsoft.com",,,,9781618395993,,,English,"Adv.

In the current context, with constantly increasing constraints like requirement ambiguity and complex development process, developing a fault free reliable software is a daunting task. To deliver reliable software, software engineers are required to execute exhaustive test cases which become tedious and costly for software enterprises. To ameliorate the testing process one can use a defect prediction model so that testers can focus their efforts on defect prone modules. Software defect prediction models use historical defect database to forecast error-prone modules. Defect prediction models require empirical validation to ensure their relevance to a software company.

Fourier-Bessel (FB) expansion is used instead of Fourier transform for representing the signal in frequency domain. FB expansion can be viewed as two-dimensional Fourier transform. Change in the kernel of the transform from exponential to decaying exponentials helps in viewing the speech signal as a linear sum of decaying exponentials. For signals arising out of acoustic tubes, where the signal is subjected to many damping effects, delays in the different components of the signal is inevitable. Representing such signals using FB coefficients helps in able identification of different components present in the signal. The random non-stationary nature of speech signal is more efficiently represented by damped sinusoidal nature of basis function that is more natural for the voiced speech signal since Bessel functions have damped sinusoidal as basis function, so it is more natural choice for the representation of natural signals. Vocal tract is modeled as a set of linear acoustic tubes being cylindrical in shape can be efficiently modeled using FB expansion because Bessel functions are solutions to cylindrical wave equations. The proposed approach to speaker identification is based on FBCC features, and method employ Gaussian mixture for modeling the speaker characteristics. However, we have build the speaker models from the Fourier-Bessel features derived from the speech samples, as an alternative to Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and linear prediction cepstral coefficients (LPCC) for building the speaker models. An evaluation of the Gaussian mixture model is conducted on TIMIT database which consists of 630 speakers and 10 speech utterances per speaker and white noise signals of TIMIT database having various SNRs of 50, 40, 30 and 20 dB. Using the statistical model like Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and features extracted from the speech signals build a unique identity for each person who enrolled for speaker identification [1]. Estimation and Maximization algorithm is used for finding the maximum likelihood solution for a model with features, to test the later speeches against the database of all speakers who enrolled in the database. Experimental results shows that the FBCC can be used as the alternate feature for the LPCC and MFCC since it can improve the performance of the speaker identification task.",Bessel coefficients; FBCC; Gaussian mixer model; MFCC; Speaker identification,Bessel coefficients; FBCC; Gaussians; MFCC; Speaker identification; Acoustics; Artificial intelligence; Bessel functions; Fourier transforms; Loudspeakers; Speech; Tubes (components); White noise; Speech recognition,"Prakash, C.; Speech and Vision Laboratory, Department of LTRC, International Institute of Technology, Hyderabad - 577 032, Andra pradesh, India; email: chetana@research.iiit.ac.in",,,,9780972741286,,,English,"Proc.

Previously one of the authors has been calculated the gestational age of fetus. In this paper a method for the automatic measurement of fetal weight which is very important factor in context of fetal abnormality has been presented. Fetal femur length measurements are used to estimate fetal weight by using the EFW formula. By using a real-time ultrasound system, sonographers currently indicate the femur endpoints on the ultrasound display station with a mouse-like device. The measurements are subjective and have been proven to be inconsistent. The automatic approach described in this paper exploits a prior knowledge of the general range of femoral size and shape by using morphological operators, which process images based on shape characteristics.

Presence of a continuous horizontal line called 'Matra' is an important feature of this script. However, in unconstrained cursive handwriting, Matra can be wavy or discontinuous, makes the problem of segmentation difficult. The current work designs a novel technique for identification of potential segmentation points on the Matra for isolating constituent characters from the word image of Bangla script. In the first stage, 8-neighbour Connected Component Labelling (CCL) algorithm is applied to identify connected sub-parts of the word images. These connected components are then classified into either of the two classes, namely 'Segment further' (SF) and 'Do Not Segment' (DNS). In the second stage, the trivial SF and DNS components are separated. Then the remaining components are classified into SF and DNS using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier. Finally, fuzzy segmentation features are used over the SF components to identify potential segmentation points on the detected fuzzy Matra region for extraction of constituent characters or character sub-parts from the overall word images. The present technique has been successfully applied on 500 handwritten Bangla word images and it is also found that the technique performs better than our earlier character segmentation techniques [1-2].",Bangla script; Character segmentation; Component classification; Fuzzy features; Handwritten word images; OCR system,Bangla script; Character segmentation; Connected component; Fuzzy features; Fuzzy segmentation; Handwritten words; Multi layer perceptron; Novel techniques; Off-line handwritten; Offline handwritten character segmentation; Remaining component; Word images; Work design; Artificial intelligence; Job analysis; Optical character recognition; Internet protocols,"Malakar, S.; Dept. of Master of Computer Application, M.C.K.V.

The concepts which have these event specific relations are considered as event terms. Hence the effort required to identify the event and non event sentences are reduced. This work considers the event weight score for computing the event context similarity between the documents. The agglomerative clustering is modified by incorporating the event specific relation weight, position score, along with the TF(Term Frequency)-IDF(Inverse Document Frequency) score.

The image enhancement achieved by algorithms such as histogram equalization, adaptive histogram equalization, homomorphic filtering and Multiscale Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) etc., improves the contrast, luminance and dynamic range compression. However, these algorithms introduces halo artifacts, violates the gray world assumption and edge details of an image is lost. A major concern is that there is no accurate objective criterion for assessing the performance of image enhancement algorithms. Researchers developed some objective criteria such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), contrast enhancement performance, luminance enhancement performance and Structural Similarity Measurement (SSIM) etc. However, they could not solve the problem satisfactorily, and it often uses visual inspection and subjective criteria to evaluate the performance of these image enhancement algorithms. This paper proposes an objective and effective assessment criterion, Wavelet Energy (WE), to evaluate the performance of the color image enhancement algorithms. The proposed scheme describes both textual and structural information changes in an enhanced image. Numerous experiments were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric over the existing metrics.

Efforts to address the problem range from heuristics based approaches that search the subspaces of the coalition structure to evolutionary learning approaches. Conventional approaches typically strive to optimize a single objective function such as the number of tasks executed or the time required to execute all tasks, or a weighted function of such objectives. In real world applications, objectives such as minimizing distance traveled and maximizing the number of tasks completed are often conflicting in nature. The coalition formation problem thus naturally lends itself to a multi-objective optimization approach based on evolutionary learning. In this paper, we formulate the problem of mapping coalitions of robots to a set of tasks as a multi-objective optimization problem and propose a variant of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to arrive at trade-off solutions. Time deadlines in real life scenarios being generally soft, we refine the model to incorporate fuzzy deadlines. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in generating the set of Pareto optimal solutions.",,Coalition formations; Coalition structure; Complex task; Conventional approach; Evolutionary Learning; Fuzzy deadline; Multi objective optimizations (MOO); Multi-objective optimization problem; Multiple objectives; Multiple robot; Multiple robot system; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; NSGA-II; Pareto optimal solutions; Real-world application; Single objective; Tradeoff solution; Weighted function; Industrial robots; Multiobjective optimization; Artificial intelligence,"Agarwal, M.; Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi, Delhi-110007, India",,,,9780972741286,,,English,"Proc.

Hunger is considered to be a critical factor governing the animal's behavior in such studies. Despite its significance, most theories of animal conditioning fail to take hunger into consideration, while analyzing the behavioral data. In this paper, we analyze the neuroscientific data supporting the hypothesis that hunger and food consumption affect the brain's dopamine system, which in turn governs the animal's behavior. According to this hypothesis, chronic hunger results in a decrease in the extracellular dopamine levels in the animal's brain. This decrease is believed to trigger a series of reactions that increase the responsivity of the phasic dopamine system. A direct consequence of this is an increased vigor of all dopamine-dependent behaviors. The level of extra-cellular dopamine is also modulated by the process of food consumption. Food consumption raises the dopamine above the baseline level. This raise depends on the animals' hunger, such that once the hunger is satisfied, the dopamine level falls back to the baseline. This extra-cellular dopamine governs the response vigor, with an increase in dopamine resulting in a more vigorous response. We present a mathematical model based on this hypothesis. Our model is able to provide a simple explanation for a number of behavioral findings.",,Baseline levels; Behavioral data; Critical factors; Extracellular; Food consumption; Responsivity; Amines; Animals; Artificial intelligence; Food supply; Mathematical models; Neurophysiology,"Vig, L.; School of Copmutational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India; email: lovekeshvigin@gmail.com",,,,9780972741286,,,English,"Proc.

Here the islands of relevant images corresponding to a query are tagged with query index. These islands of many queries are merged based on some criteria like overlapping, nearness etc., to obtain overall merged clusters with associated tagged query indices. Given a query, the initial retrieval set is obtained by combination of two schemes, one uses RF log that covers search based on nearby concept images and the other is based on simply the Mahalanobis distance of the query with database images.

Moreover, recent publications showed that, contrary to a popular belief, multimodal biometric systems in parallel fusion mode can be evaded even if only one trait is spoofed. Those results were obtained, using simulated spoof attacks, under the assumption that the spoofed and genuine samples are indistinguishable, which may not be true for all biometric traits. Security of multimodal biometric systems in serial fusion mode against spoof attacks has so far not been investigated. We further empirically investigate the performance and security issue of serial and parallel biometric fusion modes, using real spoof attack samples under different spoof attack scenarios. Preliminary empirical results on real biometric systems made up of face, fingerprint and iris confirm that multimodal biometric systems in both fusion modes are not intrinsically robust against spoof attacks as believed so far. In particular, multimodal biometric systems in serial fusion mode can be even less robust than systems in parallel mode. We also experimentally found that incorporating the biometric sample quality in biometric fusion increases the robustness of the multimodal systems against spoof attacks. In this paper, in the end we study the trade-off between performance and robustness of the biometric systems under spoof attacks.",Biometric fusion; Biometric sample quality; Biometrics; Multimodal systems; Spoof attacks,Attack scenarios; Biometric fusion; Biometric systems; Biometric traits; Multimodal biometric systems; Multimodal system; Parallel mode; Sample quality; Security issues; Serial fusion; Spoof attacks; Artificial intelligence; Biometrics; Pattern recognition systems; Security of data,"Akhtar, Z.; Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of CagliariItaly; email: z.momin@diee.unica.it",,,,9780972741286,,,English,"Proc.

Since the MCPL estimation problem is nonlinear in nature, a homotopy continuation based algorithm has been developed to obtain the estimates of model parameters. The image label estimation is formulated using Maximum a Posteriori criterion and the MAP estimates are obtained using hybrid algorithm, a combination of SA and ICM algorithm. The unsupervised algorithm consisting of estimation of model parameters and estimation of image labels converge to partial optimal set of model parameters which in turn yields image labels and hence image segmentation. The performance of the proposed COMRF model has been compared with MRF model and Kato 's method and found to exhibit improved performance.",Color image; Color model; Segmentation; Simulated annealing and MRF model,Color image segmentation; Color images; Color models; Estimation problem; Homotopy continuation; Homotopy continuation methods; Hybrid algorithms; ICM algorithms; Markov Random Field model; Markov Random Fields; Maximum a posteriori criteria; Model parameter estimation; Model parameters; Optimal sets; Pseudo-likelihood; Unsupervised algorithms; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Color; Color image processing; Estimation; Image segmentation; Maximum likelihood estimation; Simulated annealing; Parameter estimation,"Nanda, P.K.; Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering I.T.E.R, Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University, Jagmohan Nagar, Khandagiri Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India; email: pknanda.nitrkl@gmail.com",,,,9780972741286,,,English,"Proc.

All these are also subjective and dependant on a variety of factors to realize at acceptable levels of threshold.

Network traffic generates huge data in real time. Number of records as well as parameters/features to be monitored is large. Feature selection and ranking plays important role in classification. Existence of irrelevant parameter results in poor performance. Ignoring a relevant parameter on the other hand will result in loss of information and hence accuracy. Prevailing techniques construct ""static reduced feature sets?, which is used for classifiers. None of the feature selection method generates optimal reduced set. In this paper a novel approach is presented for selecting subset of features based on individual test cases. The success of algorithm is demonstrated on KDD-CUP99 data. During learning phase, training sample is partitioned based on value of the respective parameter. This results in generation of equivalence classes respective to 'm' parameters. While classifying the test case, each parameter value results in one set from each equivalence class generated during learning. Parameters are ranked based on the ascending cardinality of 'm' such partial solution sets. Intersection of sets, thus obtained will result in set of objects satisfying the test case parameters. Algorithm terminates when either a pure class or a null result is obtained or when all parameters exhaust with confused decision.

One method commonly used to process COP signals is time-frequency analysis, with higher frequencies of postural sway interpreted as tightly controlled posture. However, standard Fourier transform based methods are poorly suited to COP signals due to their inherent non-stationarity. A new method of mean frequency estimation is proposed for COP signals based on the Fourier-Bessel (FB) expansion that is suitable for use in non-stationary signals. In addition, FB expansion provides better frequency resolution and low frequency detectability. Seventeen subjects were tested under eyes open and eyes closed conditions, with different vibration frequencies applied for the eyes closed condition in order to further perturb sensory information.

In fact the internal components are generated from external (ontological) component. That's the reason agile development approaches such as Feature Driven Development (FDD) are suitable for application's internal component development. The FDD process is based on its first step of developing the ""overall model"" which is build using the information in requirement document and later used for deriving the feature list but there is no particular representation for this model that can be used for checking the quality of model.

In conventional architecture of expert system, knowledge engineers along with domain experts build the knowledgebase in terms of facts and rules. This knowledgebase resides in the working memory of the inference engine and only accessible to one system. This knowledgebase is not portable and cannot be made accessible to other applications concurrently. Moreover, traditional rule-base systems are not inherently based on Unicode and thus lacks support for internationalization or for regional languages.

In this paper, some standard computational techniques are applied within the framework of Content-boosted collaborative filtering with imputational rating data to evaluate and produce CF predictions. The Content-boosted collaborative filtering algorithm uses either naive Bayes or means imputation, depending on the sparsity of the original CF rating dataset.

Although PSO trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) performed reasonably well in stationary time series forecasting, their effectiveness in tracking the structure of non-stationary data (especially those which contain trends or seasonal patterns) is yet to be justified. In this paper, we have trained neural networks with two types of PSO (Trelea1 and Trelea2) for forecasting seasonal time series data. To assess their performances, experiments are conducted on three well-known real world seasonal time series. Obtained forecast errors in terms of three common performance measures, viz. MSE, MAE and MAPE for each dataset are compared with those obtained by the Seasonal ANN (SANN) model, trained with a standard backpropagation algorithm.

The direction of a normal mammary gland is toward the nipple, whereas the direction in an abnormal gland or region will be towards distorted area. Gabor filters are used for the detection of line patterns to obtain the orientation field of the given mammogram. Node maps are drawn using phase portraits to analyze the orientation fields and to detect the sites of architectural distortion. To reduce the number of false positives: computerized flow field analysis is done using distance measure (nonlinear least squares) to calculate the degree of distortion at each node point, denseness texture feature is considered at each node point and the structure of left and right breasts are compared using quadrant based comparison. The method was tested with 19 mammograms containing architectural distortion.

Furthermore, Hindi Digit can be drawn in different sizes. Therefore, a robust offline Hindi handwritten recognition system has to account for all of these factors. In the proposed method each character is subjected to thinning followed by size normalization.

Such losses can be reduced to a considerable extent if their occurrence is known in advance so that timely remedial measures may be taken. Thus there is a need to develop forewarning systems which can provide advance information for outbreak of pests/diseases attack. Weather plays vital role in development of pests and diseases infestation in crops, therefore, a technique for forewarning pests/diseases may be obtained on the basis of weather variables. Most of the earlier workers have utilised regression models (both linear and non linear) for pests/diseases forewarning. Recently artificial neural network (ANNs) techniques have become the focus of much attention, largely because of their wide range of applicability and the ease with which they can treat complicated problems even if the data are imprecise and noisy. From statistical perspective, neural networks are interesting because of their potential use in prediction. This methodology has been explored for forewarning Alternaria blight in mustard for maximum disease severity, crop age at first appearance of disease and crop age at maximum disease severity as response variables and weather indices as predictors for three locations namely Bharatpur, Dholi and Berhampur.

Significant amount of work has been done in this area in the form of shot segmentation techniques and they often give reasonably good results. However, shots are not of much importance for the semantic analysis of the videos. For semantic and meaningful analysis of the videos (e.g. movies), scene is more important since it captures one complete unit of action. People have tried different approaches in scene segmentation but almost all of them use color, texture etc. to compute scene boundaries. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on a Bag of Words(BoW) representation which computes semantic similarity between shots using a Bipartite Graph Model (BGM). Based on semantic similarity, we detect the scene boundaries in the movie. We have tested our algorithm on a multiple Hollywood movies, and the proposed method is found to give good results.",,Bag of words; Bipartite graphs; Indexing and retrieval; Scene segmentation; Semantic analysis; Semantic similarity; Shot segmentation; Video scene segmentation; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Graph theory; Semantics; Motion pictures,"Kumar, N.; Center for Visual Information Technology, IIIT Hyderabad, Gachibowli, Hyderabad-32, India",,,,9780972741286,,,English,"Proc.

However, type-1 fuzzy set used in conventional FCM is unable to handle uncertainty in better way present in the brain image. The research work has shown better segmentation result when type-2 fuzzy set, which is an extension of type-1, is used in conventional FCM. To the best of our knowledge, the higher order fuzzy sets, which can handle uncertainty in better way, is not used with conventional FCM.

Determination of status of water quality is highly indeterminate. The purpose of this study is to bring about an association between the parameters in order to assess water quality. The term quality ascribed to water is itself fuzzy as it is only a relative term. However, in a more general characterization, it can be said that increase in total hardness (TH) is due to increase in calcium and magnesium. But, it is impossible to develop a precise mathematical model that can predict crisp numerical values of calcium or magnesium that correspond to crisp values of hardness. Similar argument holds good for total dissolved solids (TDS). TDS consists of inorganic salts such as carbonates, bicarbonates, chlorides, sulphates, phosphates of calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, etc. and small amount of organic matter and dissolved gases. The determination of water quality due to contamination is highly unpredictable in crisp numerical terms. It may be necessary, with the help of previous experience, to generate additional linguistic expressions for the definition of related water quality parameters. The potential of fuzzy logic in developing qualitative model for characterization by approximate reasoning really lies here. Fuzzy set theory provides a powerful tool for modelling uncertainty associated with vagueness and imprecision. The present study deals with fifteen parametric variables that include Sodium, Potassium, Iron, Calcium, Magnesium, Bicarbonate, Carbonate, Chloride, Fluoride, Nitrates, Sulphates, Total Dissolved Solids, Conductivity, Hardness, pH. The experimental data is modeled in seven distinct steps. In the first five steps, one antecedent and one consequent models are developed. In the last two steps, two antecedents and one consequent models are developed. In total, seven fuzzy inference systems are built. An attempt has also been made to establish sensitivity of parameters. Results indicate that, TDS and total hardness turns to be very significant parameters to determine water quality. It is concluded that, the fuzzy inference system provides a prudent way to capture uncertainty in relationships among parameters that control the water quality.",Anions; Cations; Linguistic expressions; TDS; TH; WQM,Approximate reasoning; Data driven; Dissolved gas; Fuzzy inference systems; Inorganic salts; Linguistic expressions; Modern time; Numerical values; Parametric modeling; Parametric variables; Qualitative model; Sensitivity of parameters; Sulphates; TDS; Total dissolved solids; Water quality parameters; WQM; Artificial intelligence; Calcium; Calcium carbonate; Chlorine compounds; Digital storage; Dissolution; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy systems; Hardness; Linguistics; Magnesium; Mathematical models; Negative ions; Positive ions; Thorium; Uncertainty analysis; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Water hardness,"Jayaram, M.A.; Department of Master of Computer ApplicationsIndia; email: ma_jayaram@rediffmail.com",,,,9780972741286,,,English,"Proc.

We show how ants can use repellent pheromones and incorporate the effect of crowding to avoid traffic congestion on the optimal path. Based on these interactions, we propose an ant algorithm, the M-unit EigenAnt algorithm, that leads to the selection of the M shortest paths. The ratio of selection of each of these paths is also optimal and regulated by an optimal amount of pheromone on each of them. To the best of our knowledge, the M-unit EigenAnt algorithm is the first ant algorithm that explicitly ensures the selection of the M shortest paths and regulates the amount of pheromone on them such that it is asymptotically optimal. Intact, it is in contrast with most ant algorithms that aim to discover just a single best path. We provide its convergence analysis and show that the steady state distribution of pheromone aligns with the eigenvectors of the cost matrix, and thus is related to its measure of quality. We also provide analysis to show that this property ensues even when the food is moved or path lengths change during foraging. We show that this behavior is robust in the presence of fluctuations and quickly reflects the change in the M optimal solutions. This makes it suitable for not only distributed applications but also dynamic ones as well. Finally, we provide simulation results for the convergence to the optimal solution under different initial biases, dynamism in lengths of paths, and discovery of new paths.

In [1] the authors have proposed a likelihood ratio test (LRT) based fusion technique for the biometric verification task that outperformed several other classifiers. They model the genuine and the imposter densities by the finite Gaussian mixture models (GMM, a generative model) whose parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) criteria. Lately, the discriminative training methods and models have been shown to provide additional accuracy gains over the generative models, in multiple applications such as the speech recognition, verification and text analytics[5, 7]. These gains are based on the fact that the discriminative models are able to partially compensate for the unavoidable mismatch, which is always present between the specified statistical model (GMM in this case) and the true distribution of the data which is unknown. In this paper, we propose to use a discriminative method to estimate the GMM density parameters using the maximum accept and reject (MARS) criteria[8].

The objective is to automatically estimate physical attributes of the targets that would allow us to analyze its behavior non-intrusively. Proposed system estimates the anthropometric skeleton, pose and shape of the human target from the 3D visual hull reconstructed from multiple silhouettes of the target. Discriminative (bottom-up) method is used to first initialize 3D pose of the targets using low-level features extracted from the 2D image. The pose is refined using generative (top-down) method that also estimates the optimal skeleton of the target using anthropometric prior models learned from the CAESAR dataset. Statistical shape models are also learned from the CAESAR dataset and are used to model both global and local shape variability of human body parts. We also propose a novel optimization scheme to fit 3D shape by searching in the parametric space of local parts model and constraining the overall shape using a global shape model.

Rules are assumed to be conjunctions of basic propositions concerning the values taken by the input features. From the perspectives of interpretability as well as generalization, it is highly desirable to construct rule ensembles with low training error, having rules that are i) simple, i.e., involve few conjunctions and ii) few in number. We propose to explore the (exponentially) large feature space of all possible conjunctions optimally and efficiently by employing the recently introduced Hierarchical Kernel Learning (HKL) framework. The regularizer employed in the HKL formulation can be interpreted as a potential for discouraging selection of rules involving large number of conjunctions - justifying its suitability for constructing rule ensembles. Simulation results show that, in case of many benchmark datasets, the proposed approach improves over state-of-the-art REL algorithms in terms of generalization and indeed learns simple rules. Unfortunately, HKL selects a conjunction only if all its subsets are selected. We propose a novel convex formulation which alleviates this problem and generalizes the HKL framework. The main technical contribution of this paper is an efficient mirrordescent based active set algorithm for solving the new formulation. Empirical evaluations on REL problems illustrate the utility of generalized HKL.

Compared to previous generalizations of ""NormalizedCuts"" which incorporate constraints, our technique has two advantages. First, we seek solutions which are sufficiently ""correlated"" with priors which allows us to use noisy top-down information, for example from an object detector. Second, given the spectral solution of the unconstrained problem, the solution of the constrained one can be computed in small additional time, which allows us to run the algorithm in an interactive mode.

Given the registration parameters, layout of the template image is superimposed on the test document. Registration algorithms have been popular in applications, such as forms processing where the superimposed layout is used to extract relevant fields. Prior art has been designed to work with scanned documents under affine transformation. We find that the proliferation of camera captured images makes it necessary to address camera noise such as non-uniform lighting, clutter, and highly variable scale/resolution. The absence of a scan bed also leads to challenging non-rigid deformations being seen in paper images. Prior approaches in point pattern based registration like RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) [4], and Thin Plate Spline-Robust Point Matching (TPS-RPM) [5, 6] form the basis of our work. We propose enhancements to these methods to enable registration of cell phone and camera captured documents under non-rigid transformations. We embed three novel aspects into the framework: (i) histogram based uniformly transformed correspondence estimation, (ii) clustering of points located near the regions of interest (ROI) to select only close by regions for matching, (iii) validation of the registration in RANSAC and TPS-RPM algorithms for non-rigid registration.

We present an on-line approach for rapidly adapting a black box classifier to a new test data set without retraining the classifier or examining the original optimization criterion. Assuming the original classifier outputs a continuous number for which a threshold gives the class, we reclassify points near the original boundary using a Gaussian process regression scheme. We show how this general procedure can be used in the context of a classifier cascade, demonstrating performance that far exceeds state-of-the-art results in face detection on a standard data set.

Since a lot of time is spent in constructing relevant queries, automatically creating them from a patent would save the examiner a lot of effort. In this paper, we address the problem of automatically creating queries from an input patent. An optimal query can be formed by extracting important keywords or phrases from a patent by using Key Phrase Extraction (KPE) techniques. Several KPE algorithms have been proposed in the literature but their performance on query construction for patents has not yet been explored. We systematically evaluate and analyze the performance of queries created by using state-of-the-art KPE techniques for invalidity search task.

The formulations assume that the given kernels are grouped and employ ℓ1 norm regularization for promoting sparsity within RKHS norms of each group and ℓs, s≥2 norm regularization for promoting non-sparse combinations across groups. Various sparsity levels in combining the kernels can be achieved by varying the grouping of kernels-hence we name the formulations as Variable Sparsity Kernel Learning (VSKL) formulations. While previous attempts have a non-convex formulation, here we present a convex formulation which admits efficient Mirror-Descent (MD) based solving techniques. The proposed MD based algorithm optimizes over product of simplices and has a computational complexity of O (m2ntot lognmax/ε2) where m is no. training data points, nmax, ntot are the maximum no. kernels in any group, total no. kernels respectively and ε is the error in approximating the objective. A detailed proof of convergence of the algorithm is also presented. Experimental results show that the VSKL formulations are well-suited for multi-modal learning tasks like object categorization.

Usually, no attempt is made to identify sensitive parameters, and those that are used are often given ""factory-supplied"" default values, or values obtained from some non-systematic exploratory analysis. The immediate consequence of this is, of course, that it is not clear if better models could have been obtained if some form of parameter selection and optimisation had been performed. Questions follow inevitably on the experiments themselves: specifically, are all algorithms being treated fairly, and is the exploratory phase sufficiently well-defined to allow the experiments to be replicated? In this paper, we investigate the use of parameter selection and optimisation techniques grouped under the study of experimental design. Screening and response surface methods determine, in turn, sensitive parameters and good values for these parameters. Screening is done here by constructing a stepwise regression model relating the utility of an ILP system's hypothesis to its input parameters, using systematic combinations of values of input parameters (technically speaking, we use a two-level fractional factorial design of the input parameters). The parameters used by the regression model are taken to be the sensitive parameters for the system for that application. We then seek an assignment of values to these sensitive parameters that maximise the utility of the ILP model. This is done using the technique of constructing a local ""response surface"". The parameters are then changed following the path of steepest ascent until a locally optimal value is reached. This combined use of parameter selection and response surface-driven optimisation has a long history of application in industrial engineering, and its role in ILP is demonstrated using well-known benchmarks. The results suggest that computational overheads from this preliminary phase are not substantial, and that much can be gained, both on improving system performance and on enabling controlled experimentation, by adopting well-established procedures such as the ones proposed here. © 2011 Ashwin Srinivasan and Ganesh Ramakrishnan.",Experimental design; Inductive Logic Programming; Parameter screening and optimisation,Computational overheads; Constructing models; Controlled experimentation; Default values; Designed experiments; Experimental design; Exploratory analysis; Fractional factorial designs; ILP models; Improving systems; Inductive logic; Input parameter; Optimal values; Optimisations; Parameter screening; Parameter selection; Regression model; Response surface; Response surface method; Sensitive parameter; Specific values; Steepest ascent; Stepwise regression; Benchmarking; Computer programming; Design; Experiments; Optimization; Regression analysis; Statistics; Surface properties; Inductive logic programming (ILP),"Srinivasan, A.; School of Mathematical Sciences, ICT, South Asian University, New Delhi 110067, India; email: ASHWIN.SRINIVASAN@WOLFSON.OXON.ORG",,,15324435,,,,English,J.

In contrast to existing methods for learning polyhedral classifier which solve a constrained optimization problem, our method solves an unconstrained optimization problem. Our method is based on a logistic function based model for the posterior probability function. We propose an alternating optimization algorithm, namely, SPLA1 (Single Polyhedral Learning Algorithm1) which maximizes the log-likelihood of the training data to learn the parameters. We also extend our method to make it independent of any user specified parameter (e.g., number of hyperplanes required to form a polyhedral set) in SPLA2. We show the effectiveness of our approach with experiments on various synthetic and real world datasets and compare our approach with a standard decision tree method (OC1) and a constrained optimization based method for learning polyhedral sets (Astorino and Gaudioso, 2002). © 2010 Naresh Manwani and P.

Because one human face is always bare and human beings often use them in their visual interactions. The automatic recognition of human face presents a significant challenge research. Human faces are very similar in structure with minor difference from person to person. 3D face recognition methods are able to overcome the problems resulting from illumination, expression or pose variations in 2D face recognition. Utilize the symmetry of the face for face recognition, select average half-face for research. The average-half-face is constructed from the full frontal face image in two steps: First the face image is centered and divided in half and two halves are averaged together. The consequence of this discovery may result in substantial savings in storage and computation time. Principle component analysis for recognizing the human faces is an efficient manner with additional effect PCA provides a road map for how to reduce a complex data set to a lower dimension. Simplified dynamics that are underlying. Wavelet transforms have become one of the basic tools of signal processing, image processing and numerical computation. While it is a relatively simple matter to either identify a human face or classify between different ones, it would be very interesting to see if we could use wavelet transforms to achieve better and more robust results. One of most characteristics of wavelet transforms is their ability to represent a signal into partitions of time-frequency plane.

To further raise the performance of pattern matching algorithm, an efficient algorithm called Modified Berry-Ravindran Bad Character (MBrBc) is presented.

MulitiPRF showed remarkable improvement over plain Model Based Feedback (MBF) uniformly for 4 languages, viz., French, German, Hungarian and Finnish with English as the assisting language. This fact inspired us to study the effect of any source-assistant pair on MultiPRF performance from out of a set of languages with widely different characteristics, viz., Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German and Spanish. Carrying this further, we looked into the effect of using two assisting languages together on PRF. The present paper is a report of these investigations, their results and conclusions drawn therefrom. While performance improvement on MultiPRF is observed whatever the assisting language and whatever the source, observations are mixed when two assisting languages are used simultaneously.

Many supervised WSD systems have been built, but the effort of creating the training corpus - annotated sense marked corpora - has always been a matter of concern. Therefore, attempts have been made to develop unsupervised and knowledge based techniques for WSD which do not need sense marked corpora. However such approaches have not proved effective, since they typically do not better Wordnet first sense baseline accuracy. Our research reported here proposes to stick to the supervised approach, but with far less demand on annotation. We show that if we have ANY sense marked corpora, be it from mixed domain or a specific domain, a small amount of annotation in ANY other domain can deliver the goods almost as if exhaustive sense marking were available in that domain. We have tested our approach across Tourism and Health domain corpora, using also the well known mixed domain SemCor corpus. Accuracy figures close to self domain training lend credence to the viability of our approach. Our contribution thus lies in finding a convenient middle ground between pure supervised and pure unsupervised WSD.

The SMO algorithm is simple, easy to implement and adapt, and efficiently scales to large problems. As a result, it has gained widespread acceptance and SVMs are routinely trained using SMO in diverse real world applications. Training using SMO has been a long standing goal in MKL for the very same reasons. Unfortunately, the standard MKL dual is not differentiable, and therefore can not be optimised using SMO style co-ordinate ascent. In this paper, we demonstrate that linear MKL regularised with the p-norm squared, or with certain Bregman divergences, can indeed be trained using SMO. The resulting algorithm retains both simplicity and efficiency and is significantly faster than state-of-the-art specialised p-norm MKL solvers.

Past research have extensively studied the m = 1 case and have derived several algorithms which require sophisticated techniques like ACCP, SOCP, etc. The existing algorithms do not apply if one uses arbitrary losses and often can not handle m &gt; 1 case. We present several provably convergent iterative algorithms, where each iteration requires either an SVM or a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) solver for m &gt; 1 case. One of the major contributions of the paper is to extend the well knownMirror Descent(MD) framework to handle Cartesian product of psd matrices. This novel extension leads to an algorithm, called EMKL, which solves the problem in O(m 2 log n/∈ 2 ) iterations; in each iteration one solves an MKL involving m kernels and m eigen-decomposition of n × n matrices. By suitably defining a restriction on the objective function, a faster version of EMKL is proposed, called REKL, which avoids the eigen-decomposition. An alternative to both EMKL and REKL is also suggested which requires only an SVMsolver.

In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular Value Projection) for rank minimization under affine constraints (ARMP) and show that SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for affine constraints that satisfy a restricted isometry property (RIP). Our method guarantees geometric convergence rate even in the presence of noise and requires strictly weaker assumptions on the RIP constants than the existing methods. We also introduce a Newton-step for our SVP framework to speed-up the convergence with substantial empirical gains. Next, we address a practically important application of ARMP - the problem of lowrank matrix completion, for which the defining affine constraints do not directly obey RIP, hence the guarantees of SVP do not hold. However, we provide partial progress towards a proof of exact recovery for our algorithm by showing a more restricted isometry property and observe empirically that our algorithm recovers low-rank incoherent matrices from an almost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries. We also demonstrate empirically that our algorithms outperform existing methods, such as those of [5, 18, 14], for ARMP and the matrix completion problem by an order of magnitude and are also more robust to noise and sampling schemes. In particular, results show that our SVP-Newton method is significantly robust to noise and performs impressively on a more realistic power-law sampling scheme for the matrix completion problem.",,Affine Constraints; Convergence rates; Fast algorithms; Fundamental problem; Low-rank matrices; Matrix completion problems; Minimum rank; Optimal number; Power-law; Sampling schemes; Singular values; Matrix algebra; Newton-Raphson method; Rate constants; Algorithms,"Jain, P.; Microsoft Research Bangalore, Bangalore, India; email: prajain@microsoft.com",,,,9781617823800,,,English,"Adv.

Measures of texture computed using only gray level histogram moments statistical texture analysis method suffer from the limitation that they depend only on individual pixel values and not on the interaction or cooccurrence of neighboring pixel values. To solve this problem, spatial gray level co-occurrence matrices are used to extract statistical texture features in digital mammograms. Information theory based features are important texture features, which are computed from spatial gray level co-occurrence matrix, to build a robust descriptor towards correctly classifying abnormal and normal regions of mammograms. Entropy is a most important statistical texture feature based on information theory. Entropy measures the randomness of intensity distribution. In most feature descriptors, Shannon's measure is used to measure entropy. In this paper, Havrda and Charvat's measure is also used to measure entropy. Havrda and Charvat's entropy has a higher dynamic range than Shannon entropy over a range of scattering conditions, and are therefore useful in estimating scatter density and regularity.

Here, collision free offline path planning has been done for exact grid navigation. The navigation is a major challenge for robotic agents, which comprises static obstacles and a desired goal state. Hence, traversing is considered as a core issue to demonstrate the feasibility of collision free offline line path planning. In addition, a wireless channel has been set up between host computer and robotic agent. In order to deal with these issues successfully; we have proposed a scheme for shortest path determination and navigation with obstacle avoidance mechanism. A wireless map composed of coordinates (trace points, obstacle points and the final target) is transmitted in a wireless manner to the WiComBot from a mainframe computer unit by using the CC2500 wireless communication chip. In the proposed grid traversing system an Optimal Path is planned by the robotic agent in order to reach the final destination.

Minor flaws in insulation system such as blow-holes, cavities, imperfection on the surface etc are inevitable even during manufacturing stage leading to discharges called Partial Discharge (PD) eventually leading to degradation of dielectric material usually caused by erosion mechanism (tracking and treeing). PD initiated treeing of insulation system has been receiving wide attention by researchers very recently since this mechanism is categorized as a severe case of insulation degradation by electrical utilities. This phenomenon may lead to mal operation of power apparatus. Further exhaustive literature survey carried out in this field has clearly delineated on the close relationship between physics related to the degradation mechanism and nature of flaw (void, cavity etc). Further, since the time between PD initiated treeing and breakdown is much shorter than the time to tree initiation, recognition of such complex and stochastic pattern of PD becomes challenging task even for experts. Standard laboratory models simulating various types of PD initiated treeing is fabricated. An accelerated ageing test method is carried out in testing the laboratory models. PD initiated discharge patterns and treeing patterns are acquired from the direct testing circuits as proposed by IEC 60270:2000. The morphology of the treeing patterns is visually correlated to comprehend the nature of discharge. In addition PD signatures acquired from the PD measurement and acquisition system is trained and tested with neural networks to discriminate tree and PD initiated discharge fingerprints.",Electrical treeing; Feature extraction; Partial discharge; Pattern recognition; Phase-resolved analysis,Accelerated ageing tests; Acquisition systems; Degradation mechanism; Discharge patterns; Effective performance; Electrical treeing; Electrical utilities; Erosion mechanisms; IEC 60270; Insulation degradation; Insulation system; Laboratory models; Literature survey; Manufacturing stages; PD measurements; Phase-resolved analysis; Power apparatus; Testing circuits; Degradation; Dielectric materials; Feature extraction; Insulation; Morphology; Neural networks; Partial discharges; Pattern recognition; Surface discharges; Testing; Forestry; Anatomy; Degradation; Forestry; Insulation; Neural Networks; Testing,"Vengatakrishnaprabhu, M.; Department of Electrical Engineering, SASTRA University, Thanjavur-613401, Tamil Nadu, India; email: krish.coolbuddy@gmail.com",,,,9781601321480,,,English,"Proc.

We propose tractable families of such potentials that are invariant under permutations of their arguments, and call them symmetric clique potentials. We present three families of symmetric potentials-MAX, SUM, and MAJORITY. We propose cluster message passing for collective inference with symmetric clique potentials, and present message computation algorithms tailored to such potentials. Our first message computation algorithm, called a-pass, is sub-quadratic in the clique size, outputs exact messages for MAX, and computes 13/15 -approximate messages for Potts, a popular member of the SUM family. Empirically, it is upto two orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms based on graph-cuts or belief propagation. Our second algorithm, based on Lagrangian relaxation, operates on MAJORITY potentials and provides close to exact solutions while being two orders of magnitude faster. We show that the cluster message passing framework is more principled, accurate and converges faster than competing approaches. We extend our collective inference framework to exploit associativity of more general intradomain properties of instance labelings, which opens up interesting applications in domain adaptation. Our approach leads to significant error reduction on unseen domains without incurring any overhead of model retraining. © 2010 Evangelos Theodorou, Jonas Buchli and Stefan Schaal.",Clique potentials; Cluster graphs; Collective inference; Graphical models; Message passing,Associativity; Belief propagation; Clique potential; Clique size; Cluster graphs; Collective inference; Computation algorithm; Domain adaptation; Error reduction; Exact solution; GraphicaL model; Graphical models; Intra-domain; Labelings; LaGrangian relaxation; Orders of magnitude; Structured information; Graphic methods; Inference engines; Message passing; Structural frames; Clustering algorithms,"Gupta, R.; Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay, Powai Mumbai, 400076, India; email: GRAHUL@CSE.IITB.AC.IN",,,15324435,,,,English,J.

This content is a virtual gold-mine of information that can inform a range of social, governmental, and business decisions. For example, using content available on blogs and social networking sites businesses can find out what its customers are saying about their products and services. In the digital age where customer is king, the business value of ascertaining consumer sentiment cannot be overstated. People express sentiments in myriad ways. At times, they use simple, direct assertions, but most often they use sentences involving comparisons, conjunctions expressing multiple and possibly opposing sentiments about multiple features and entities, and pronominal references whose resolution requires discourse level context. Frequently people use abbreviations, slang, SMSese, idioms and metaphors. Understanding the latter also requires common sense reasoning. In this paper, we present iSEE, a fully implemented sentiment extraction engine, which makes use of statistical methods, classical NLU techniques, common sense reasoning, and probabilistic inference to extract entity and feature specific sentiment from complex sentences and dialog. Most of the components of iSEE are domain independent and the system can be generalized to new domains by simply adding domain relevant lexicons.

We introduce the scoring-rule (SR) mechanism, which biases in favor of allocating items that an agent values above the population consensus. The SR mechanism is not strategyproof but has tolerable manipulability in the sense that: (i) if every agent optimally manipulates, it reduces to APSD, and (ii) it significantly outperforms APSD for rank efficiency when only a fraction of agents are strategic.

Often a score level fusion is adopted as this approach doesn't require the vendors to reveal much about their algorithms and features. Many score level transformations have been proposed in the literature to normalize the scores which enable fusion of more than one classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel score level transformation technique that helps in fusion of multiple classifiers. The method is based on two components: quantile transform of the genuine and impostor score distributions and a power transform which further changes the score distribution to help linear classification. After the scores are normalized using the novel quantile power transform, several linear classifiers are proposed to fuse the scores of multiple classifiers.

Our algorithm, Greedy- GQ, is an extension of recent work on gradient temporal-difference learning, which has hitherto been restricted to a prediction (policy evaluation) setting, to a control setting in which the target policy is greedy with respect to a linear approximation to the optimal action-value function. A limitation of our control setting is that we require the behavior policy to be stationary. We call this setting latent learning because the optimal policy, though learned, is not manifest in behavior. Popular off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning are known to be unstable in this setting when used with linear function ap-proximation.

Given a set of L labels, a data point can be tagged with any of the 2L possible subsets. The main challenge therefore lies in optimising over this exponentially large label space subject to label correlations. Existing solutions take either of two approaches. The first assumes, a priori, that there are no label correlations and independently trains a classifier for each label (as is done in the 1-vs-All heuristic). This reduces the problem complexity from exponential to linear and such methods can scale to large problems. The second approach explicitly models correlations by pairwise label interactions. However, the complexity remains exponential unless one assumes that label correlations are sparse. Furthermore, the learnt correlations reflect the training set biases. We take a middle approach that assumes labels are correlated but does not incorporate pairwise label terms in the prediction function. We show that the complexity can still be reduced from exponential to linear while modelling dense pairwise label correlations. By incorporating correlation priors we can overcome training set biases and improve prediction accuracy. We provide a principled interpretation of the 1-vs-All method and show that it arises as a special case of our formulation. We also develop efficient optimisation algorithms that can be orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of matching such features. While a histogram-of-gradients type methods such as SIFT, GLOH and Shape Context are currently popular, several papers have suggested using orders of pixels rather than raw intensities and shown improved results for some applications. The papers suggest two different techniques for doing so: (1) A Histogram of Relative Orders in the Patch and (2) A Histogram of LBP codes. While these methods have shown good performance, they neglect the fact that the orders can be quite noisy in the presence of Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose changes to these approaches to make them robust to Gaussian noise. We also show how the descriptors can be matched using recently developed more advanced techniques to obtain better matching performance. Finally, we show that the two methods have complimentary strengths and that by combining the two descriptors, one obtains much better results than either of them considered separately. The results are shown on the standard 2D Oxford and the 3D Caltech datasets. ©2010 IEEE.",,3D reconstruction; Caltech; Data sets; Descriptors; Feature description; Feature-based method; Gaussian noise; Matching performance; Mosaicing; Relative order; Shape contexts; Type methods; Computer vision; Graphic methods; Object recognition; Three dimensional; Computational methods,"Gupta, R.; Department of Computer Science and Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai - 600036, India; email: rgupta@cse.iitm.ac.in",,,10636919,9781424469840,PIVRE,,English,Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956003875

Data mining in medicine is an emerging field of high importance for providing prognosis and a deeper understanding of the classification of neurodegenerative diseases. Given a data set of consists of 487 patients records collected from ADRC, USA. Around eight hundred and ninety patients were recruited to ADRC and diagnosed for AD (65%) and PD (40%), according to the established criteria. In our study we concentrated particularly on the major risk factors which are responsible for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This paper proposes a new model for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease by considering the most influencing risk factors. The main focus was on the selection of most influencing risk factors for both AD and PD using various attribute evaluation scheme with ranker search method.

Use of Mobile Agents for various operations like data collection and software updates in Wireless Sensor Networks is receiving significant attention recently as it increases the lifetime of the network. Mobile Agents are privileged hence they are attractive targets. Compromised mobile agents may be used to launch various attacks in turn may compromise the entire network. Also an adversary may deploy some malicious nodes which act as mobile agents. In order to provide security for the network in this paper we are proposing a simple authentication scheme for heterogeneous sensor network which uses mobile agents for efficient data collection.

Since the available bandwidth for transmission is very limited, Multimedia Applications such as video conferencing, video on demand, video telephony and remote sensing are not possible without compression. A lot of video compression techniques have been developed and the video signal transmission has followed at data rates below 64kbps.Wavelet transform based motion compensated video codec performs better compression in order to meet the rate and distortion constraint in video transmission for the available bandwidth than the block based techniques, which are followed in standard video transmissions such as H.261 and H.263.But the efficiency of those technique's depends on the way in which it estimates and compensates the object motions in the video sequence. Wavelet based embedded image coder is quite attractive in modern multimedia applications. Wavelet transform, bit plane coding and other techniques make embedded image coder practical and also provide efficient compression. In this paper, we have proposed a novel video coding using swarm intelligence in dual tree complex wavelet transform for video coding. The 3-D DDWT is an attractive video representation because it isolates motion along different directions in separate subbands. However, it is an over-complete transform with redundancy, which is going to be eliminated by choosing optimal subbands with the help of PSO. The proposed video codec does not require motion compensation and provides better performance than the 3D SPIHT (Embedded type)codec, both objectively and subjectively, and the coder allows full scalability in spatial, temporal and quality dimensions. © 2010 IEEE.",DDWT-Dualtree Discrete Wavelet Transform; DDWTVC- Dual tree Discrete Wavelet Transform with Vector Coding; NS-NoiseShaping; PSO-Particle Swarm Optimization,3D-SPIHT; Available bandwidth; Bitplane coding; Block based; Data rates; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; Dual-tree discrete wavelet transforms; Embedded images; Motion-compensated video; Multimedia applications; Noise-shaping; Object motion; Over-complete; PSO-Particle Swarm Optimization; Quality dimension; Sub-bands; Swarm Intelligence; Vector coding; Video codecs; Video coding; Video compression; Video representations; Video sequences; Video signal transmission; Video telephony; Video transmissions; Bandwidth; Bandwidth compression; Cellular automata; Data compression; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image coding; Image communication systems; Image compression; Learning systems; Military photography; Mobile telecommunication systems; Motion compensation; Partial discharges; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Remote sensing; Signal processing; Three dimensional; Transmissions; Video recording; Video signal processing; Visual communication; Wavelet analysis; Video conferencing,"Thamarai, M.; GCT, Coimbatore, India; email: sreethamarai2000@yahoo.co.in",,,,9780769539775,,,English,ICMLC - Int.

During Q-learning, an agent makes action selections in an effort to maximize a reward signal obtained from the environment. Based on reward, agent will make changes in its policy for future actions. The problem considered in this paper is the overestimation of expected value of cumulative future discounted rewards. This discounted reward is used in evaluating agent actions and policy during reinforcement learning. Due to the overestimation of discounted reward action evaluation and policy changes are not accurate. The solution to this problem results from a form Q-learning algorithm using a combination of approximation spaces and Q-learning to estimate the expected value of returns on actions.

Multicasting is the optimum technique for such group oriented applications with effective network resource utilization. But maintaining security is a critical issue in group oriented protocols with frequent membership changes. Confidentiality can be achieved through changing the key material, known as rekeying every time a new member joins the group or existing member leaves from the group. Many techniques have been proposed earlier for this purpose. In centralized approach, a single key server is responsible to generate and distribute keys. In decentralized approach, a hierarchy of key managers distributes the keys. In distributed key-agreement protocol, the group members collectively generate and distribute a group key. This paper uses combination of both de-centralized and key-agreement approaches to prevent a single point of failures and to improve the reliability as well as the performance of the system. This paper proposes new a technique(SGKP-1), using hybrid key trees, has certain advantages like secure channel establishment for the distribution of the key material, reducing the storage requirements and burden at each member, minimization of time requirement to become a new member of a group.

Routing consists of two separate but related tasks: i) Defining and selecting path in the network ii) Forwarding packets based upon the defined paths from a designated source node to a designated destination node. With the advance of wireless communication technology, small size and high performance computing and communication devices like commercial laptops and personal computers are increasingly used in convention centers, conferences and electronic classrooms. In wireless ad-hoc networks, a collection of nodes with wireless communications and networking capability communicate with each other without the aid of any centralized administrator. The nodes are powered by batteries with limited energy reservoir. It becomes difficult to recharge or replace the batteries of the nodes hence energy conservation is essential. An energy efficient routing protocol (EERP) balances node energy utilization to reduce energy consumption and increase the life of nodes thus increasing the network lifetime, reducing the routing delay and increasing the reliability of the packets reaching the destination. Wireless networks do not have any fixed communication infrastructure. For an active connection the end host as well as the intermediate nodes can be mobile. Therefore routes are subject to frequent disconnection. In such an environment it is important to minimize disruptions caused by changing topology for applications using voice and video. Power Aware Routing enables the nodes to detect misbehavior like deviation from regular routing and forwarding by observing the status of the node. By exploiting non-random behaviors for the mobility patterns that mobile user exhibit, state of network topology can be predicted and perform route reconstruction proactively in a timely manner. In this paper we propose an Energy Efficient-Power Aware routing algorithm where we have integrated energy efficiency with power awareness parameters for routing of packets. © 2010 IEEE.",Energy efficient; Power aware; Routing protocol,Communication device; Communication infrastructure; Convention center; Destination nodes; Electronic classroom; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Energy efficient routing protocol; Energy reservoirs; Frequent disconnection; High performance computing; Intermediate node; Minimize disruption; Mobile users; Mobility pattern; Network lifetime; Network topology; Node energy; Power awareness; Power-aware routing; Random behavior; Route reconstruction; Routing delay; Small size; Source nodes; Voice and video; Wireless communication technology; Wireless communications; Communication; Electric load forecasting; Electric network topology; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global system for mobile communications; Internet protocols; Laptop computers; Learning systems; Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Telecommunication networks; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ad hoc networks,"Ajina, A.; Faculty Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangalore, India; email: ajinarose@rediffmail.com",,,,9780769539775,,,English,ICMLC - Int.

They derive their usefulness from their group actions, performing physical tasks and making cooperative decisions as a Coordinated Team. To improve the performance of clustering, the method based on heuristic concept is used to obtain global search. The main advantage of clustering algorithm lies in the fact that no additional information, such as an initial partitioning of the data or the number of clusters, is needed.

Then the non-linear dynamic models obtained are calibrated with the actual conditions. These developed models will be used for the simulation of flank wear and using control variable such as cutting speed; the flank wear will be controlled.

In this paper, we investigate the use of moments features on Kannada Kagunita. Kannada characters are curved in nature with some kind of symmetric structure observed in the shape. This information can be best extracted as a feature if we extract moment features from the directional images. To recognize a Kagunita, we need to identify the vowel and the consonant present in the image. So we are finding 4 directional images using Gabor wavelets from the dynamically preprocessed original image. We analyze the Kagunita set and identify the regions with vowel information and consonant information and cut these portions from the preprocessed original image and form a set of cut images. We then extract moments features from them. These features are trained and tested for both vowel and Kagunita recognition on Multi Layer Perceptron with Back Propagation Neural Network.

This medical data set is seldom complete. Artificial neural networks require complete set of data for an accurate classification. The system explains how the pre-processing procedure and missing values influence the data set during the classification. The implemented system compares various missing value techniques and pre-processing techniques. Some combinations prove the real influence of these techniques. A classifier has applied to Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and the results were improved tremendously when using certain combination of preprocessing and missing value techniques. The experimental system achieves an excellent classification accuracy of 99% which is best than before. © 2010 IEEE.,"Artificial neural networks; Back propagation method; Diabetes mellitus; Missing value analysis, pre processing methods",Area of interest; Artificial Neural Network; Classification accuracy; Data sets; Diabetes mellitus; Experimental system; Machine-learning; Medical data; Missing values; Pima Indian Diabetes; Pre-processing; Pre-processing method; Autocorrelation; Backpropagation; Classification (of information); Data flow analysis; Learning systems; Medical problems; Processing; Value engineering; Neural networks,"Jayalskshmi, T.; Computer Science Department, CMS College of Science and Commerce, Coimbatore, India; email: jayas20@rediffmail.com",,,,9780769539775,,,English,ICMLC - Int.

With the increasing number of linear SVM formulations and decomposition algorithms publicly available, this paper performs a study on their efficiency and efficacy for text categorization tasks. Eight publicly available implementations are investigated in terms of Break Even Point (BEP), F1 measure, ROC plots, learning speed and sensitivity to penalty parameter, based on the experimental results on two benchmark text corpuses. The results show that out of the eight implementations, SVM lin and Proximal SVM perform better in terms of consistent performance and reduced training time. However being an extremely simple algorithm with training time independent of the penalty parameter and the category for which training is being done, Proximal SVM is appealing. We further investigated fuzzy proximal SVM on both the text corpuses; it showed improved generalization over proximal SVM. © 2010 IEEE.",Fuzzy proximal SVM; Proximal SVM; Support vector machines; Text categorization,Break-even point; Consistent performance; Decomposition algorithm; Learning speed; Linear Support Vector Machines; Linear SVM; Penalty parameters; Proximal SVM; SIMPLE algorithm; Text categorization; Text document; Training time; Text processing; Support vector machines,"Kumar, M.

The SGA implementation can be termed a success if the average fitness of the new generation is more than the initial average fitness.

Segmented features of face like the lips are determined using unique face feature determination. Contour of lips formed for different human moods are analyzed to identify, facial gesture. Edge detection of lips, followed by morphological operation, gives lip structure. Pattern analysis of lips using the unique histogram algorithm and subsequent comparison with different facial gesture icons gives facial gesture of human being in an image.

While a human can recognize faces easily, automated face recognition remains a great challenge in computer-based automated recognition research. One difficulty in face recognition is how to handle the variations in expression, pose, and illumination when only a limited number of training samples are available. In this paper, an Improved Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) is proposed for face recognition. Initially the eigenspace is created with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. From this space, the eigenfaces are constructed, and the most relevant eigenfaces have been selected using IPCA. With these eigenfaces, the input images are be classified based on Euclidian distance. The proposed method was tested on ORL face database. Experimental results on this database demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for face recognition with less misclassification in comparison with previous methods. © 2010 IEEE.",Eigenfaces; Eigenvectors; Face recognition; Principal component analysis,Automated face recognition; Automated recognition; Eigenfaces; Eigenspaces; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Eigenvectors; Euclidian distance; Input image; Misclassifications; ORL face database; Training sample; Computer vision; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Face recognition,"Gomathi, E.; Department of ECE, Karpagam College of Engineering, Coimbatore, India; email: egomathi@yahoo.co.uk",,,,9780769539775,,,English,ICMLC - Int.

But due to new opportunities and higher pays the strength of the labour community is getting greatly reduced. Since the farming community is unable to sustain continuation of farming, the corporate world in now becoming the caretaker of the agricultural industry. This has lead to a new era of agriculture. Today's agriculture needs to find new ways to improve efficiency. The key point here is to replace the labourers with intelligent machines. One way to achieve this goal is to utilize available robotics and artificial intelligence technologies in the form of smarter intelligent machines to reduce energy inputs in more effective ways. These machines should be able to work like humans in farms and produce results equal to or higher than the existing ones. The advent of autonomous system architecture gives us the opportunity to develop a complete new range of agricultural equipment based on smart machines. By using these machines we can increase the productivity, improve safety, and reduce costs for many agricultural purposes.

But Malayalam, a South Indian language has very less works in this area and needs further attention. This paper focuses on an efficient algorithm for recognizing the handwritten Malayalam characters. Malayalam OCR is a complex task owing to the various character scripts available and more importantly the difference in ways in which the characters are written. The dimensions are never the same and may be never mapped on to a square grid unlike English characters. Here we propose an algorithm which can accept the scanned image of handwritten characters as input and to produce the editable Malayalam characters in a predefined format as output without applying any resizing or skeletonization methods but still can produce much accurate results. Characters are grouped in to different classes based on their HLH intensity patterns. These patterns are separated from the image and fed for recognition.

The current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efficient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image. This suggests that query independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large scale data sets that could not be handled before. © 2010 Gal Chechik, Varun Sharma, Uri Shalit and Samy Bengio.",Image similarity; Large scale; Metric learning; Online learning,Data sets; Dual approach; Human evaluation; Image similarity; Large datasets; Large scale data; Large-scale applications; Loss costs; Machine-learning; Metric learning; Nearest neighbors; On-line algorithms; Online learning; Order of magnitude; Sample sizes; Scalable image; Semantic similarity; Similarity functions; Similarity measure; Single CPU; Sparse representation; State-of-the-art methods; Storage requirements; Test images; Text query; E-learning; Statistical tests; Learning algorithms,"Chechik, G.; Google, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States; email: GAL@GOOGLE.COM",,,15324435,,,,English,J.

Initially our aim to generate the encoded file for a particular file at runtime and the signature of that particular file are stored in another file to identify that particular file while decoding but we were not able to generate at runtime but rather we store the encoded file along with signature file in the database and while retrieving decoded data from encoded data we use encoded data file along with the signature file. The DNA sequences storing and transmitting them may require a huge amount of space. This web page are help to reduce the space for storing and transmitting data , also introduce one new techniques along with exiting Huffman Technique of compression routine. DNA and RNA sequences can be considered as tests over a four letter alphabet, namely {a,t,g and c} . This algorithm can approach a compression rate of 2.1 bits /base and even lower.

Although their gradient temporal difference (GTD) algorithm converges reliably, it can be very slow compared to conventional linear TD (on on-policy problems where TD is convergent), calling into question its practical utility. In this paper we introduce two new related algorithms with better convergence rates. The first algorithm, GTD2, is derived and proved convergent just as GTD was, but uses a different objective function and converges significantly faster (but still not as fast as conventional TD). The second new algorithm, linear TD with gradient correction, or TDC, uses the same update rule as conventional TD except for an additional term which is initially zero. In our experiments on small test problems and in a Computer Go application with a million features, the learning rate of this algorithm was comparable to that of conventional TD. This algorithm appears to extend linear TD to off-policy learning with no penalty in performance while only doubling computational requirements.",,Computational requirements; Computer Go; Convergence rates; Function approximators; Gradient-descent; Learning rates; Linear functions; Objective functions; Policy problem; Temporal difference learning; Temporal differences; Test problem; Approximation algorithms; Computer applications; Convergence of numerical methods; Education; Robot learning; Learning algorithms,"Sutton, R.

Human anatomy follows this rule, even for extremely convoluted shapes like the cerebral cortex or the vasculature. To achieve accurate and topologically correct delineations of anatomical structures from medical images is a critical step for many clinical and research applications. Excluding pathological cases, most macroscopic brain structures are fully connected and do not possess any topological artifact such as handles or cavities: they have the simple topology of a sphere. Many recent segmentation algorithms are able to identify and precisely locate these structures, although without constraining the topology.

Currently most of the hard drive vendors support self-monitoring, analysis and reporting technology (SMART) which are often considered unreliable for such tasks. The problem of finding alternatives to SMART for predicting disk failure is an area of active research. In this paper, we consider events recorded from live disks and show that it is possible to construct decision support systems which can detect such failures. It is desired that any such prediction methodology should have high accuracy and ease of interpretability. Black box models can deliver highly accurate solutions but do not provide an understanding of events which explains the decision given by it. To this end we explore rule based classifiers for predicting hard disk failures from various disk events. We show that it is possible to learn easy to understand rules, from disk events, which have extremely low false alarm rates on real world data. © 2009 IEEE.",False alarm rate; Hard drive failures; Rule-based learning; SMART,Black-box model; Disk events; Disk failure; False alarm rate; Hard disks; Hard drives; Interpretability; Performance degradation; Prediction methodology; Prediction tasks; Real world data; Rule-based classifier; Rule-based learning; Self-monitoring; Alarm systems; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Disks (machine components); Errors; Forecasting; Hard disk storage; Learning systems; Water supply tunnels; Disks (structural components),"Agrawal, V.; Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India; email: agrvipul@csa.iisc.ernet.in",,,,9780769539263,,,English,"Int.

There are some search engines that provide the means to find opinion about the topic by listing a few opinionated sites. We have observed that the opinions obtained from these sites are inadequate and may not represent the entire web community. In this paper an attempt is made to collect opinions about the products from various search engines. We show that, how these opinions vary resulting in ambiguous view of the products.

In literature k-class SVM is constructed using One against All, One against One and Decision tree based SVM using Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance. To maintain high generalization ability, the most separable classes should be separated at the upper nodes of decision tree. The ratio of interclass and intraclass scatters is one of the most commonly used distance measure for class separability in pattern recognition community. In this paper, we propose decision tree SVM framework with class separability measured by ratio of interclass and intraclass scatters. It is shown that the decision tree based SVM requires less computation time in comparison to conventional One against All SVM. Experimental results on UCI repository dataset demonstrates equivalent or better performance of our proposed decision tree scheme in comparison to conventional One against All SVM in terms of classification accuracy for most of the datasets. The proposed scheme outperforms conventional One against All SVM in terms of computation time for both training and testing phase.

By using MT and GEP methods, the relationships between SSL and river discharges are established for a case study. To evaluate the performance of developed models, the model results are compared with the results of conventional methods such as sediment raring curve (SRC) and multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques.

The algorithm utilizes an intelligent integration of the chemotaxis, anemo- taxis and spiralling approaches, where the chemotactic behavior is im-plemented by the recently proposed Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) algorithm. Agents switch between chemotactic, anemotactic, and spiralling modes in accordance with the information available from the environment for optimal performance. An important feature of the algorithm is the use of maximum concentration encountered in the recent past for navigation, which is seen to improve algorithmic performance significantly. We have shown the simultaneous capture of multiple odor sources by the proposed algorithm. The proposed approach for capturing multiple odor sources is later tested on data obtained from a dye mixing experiment. It is also seen capable of locating odor source under varying wind conditions.

There has been extensive research on coherent subspace clustering of gene expressions measured under consistent experimental settings. However, these methods assume that all experiments are run using the same batch of microarray chips with similar characteristics of noise. Algorithms developed under this assumption may not be applicable for analyzing data collected from heterogeneous settings, where the set of genes being monitored may be different and expression levels may not be directly comparable even for the same gene. In this paper, we propose a bi-clustering model that imitates the ecosystem taking into account the features of biological data for mining subspace coherent patterns from heterogeneous gene expression data. We have implemented the system using an Ant Colony algorithm The system decides the number of bi-clusters automatically. The system processes the input biological data, runs the Ant Colony Algorithm, assigns bi-clusters to the genes and conditions simultaneously and displays the output.

The goal is achieved by embedding important information (image digest) which is extracted from the original image itself, and is used to introduce sufficient redundancy in the transmitted image. Half-toning technique is applied to obtain image digest from its low-resolution version. At the decoder side, the extracted image digest is used to correct the damaged regions. DTCWT, instead of conventional discrete wavelet transform (DWT), is used to decompose the original image in order to achieve two-fold advantages viz. (1) high embedding capacity due to inherent redundancy that leads to the better reconstruction of high volume missing data, and (2) better imperceptibly after data embedding since DTCWT most closely captures HYS (human visual system) characteristics than conventional DWT. Experimental results duly support the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

A novel method of medical ultrasound image despeckling using the contourlet transform is presented. The log transformed ultrasound image is contourlet transformed to obtain contourlet coefficients. The number of levels of Laplacian pyramidal decomposition, the number of directional decompositions to perform on each pyramidal level are determined. The transformed image is denoised by applying thresholding technique on individual bandpass subbands using a Bayes' shrinkage rule. The performance is measured in terms of variance, Mean Square Error (MSE), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Correlation Coefficient (CC). Finally, a comparison of performance of wavelet-based despeckling and contourlet based despeckling is provided. It is shown that the contourlet transform method has better performance than wavelet transform method.

It advocates for incrementally expanding the number of learned character classes from more frequently occurred to less frequently occurred ones. The work is preceded by a survey for finding the frequencies of occurrences of all Bangla characters in the standard literature. One important finding of the survey is that only 4.27 percent of characters in a standard text piece are on average compound characters. Out of the 160 compound character classes, characters of 55 classes constitute 90 percent of the compound characters occurring on average in a standard text piece. For the time being, handwritten characters from these classes are considered here. The average recognition rate, as observed under this work, is 84.67percent after 3 fold cross validation of results. It is more or less comparable with the performance reported in another related work[3J.

We formulate the problem of table identification as a sequence labelling task and use machine learning technique like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

The proposed method employs symbolic representation of off-line signatures using bi-interval valued symbolic feature vector. Distance and orientation features of centroids of off-line signatures are used to form bi-interval valued symbolic feature vector for representing signatures. We investigate the feasibility of the proposed fusion based representation scheme for signature verification on MCYT signature database [1] of 2250 signatures. Unlike other signature verification methods, the proposed method is simple and efficient. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of using a proposed approach of feature level fusion of distance and orientation features for off-line signature verification.

Therefore, there is a need to investigate data mining algorithm from a new point of view that is of personal privacy. Most of the conventional data mining algorithms have been developed to work on transactions with binary values. However, transactions with quantitative values are commonly found in real world applications. Therefore, we attempt to propose a method to hide useful fuzzy association rules from quantitative data. The proposed algorithm integrates the fuzzy set concepts and Apriori mining algorithm to find useful fuzzy association rules in quantitative data and then hide them using privacy preserving technique. For hiding purpose, we decrease the confidence of the rule to be hidden by increasing the support value of Left Hand Side (L.H.S.) of the rule only. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm hides more rules and generates fewer side effects and thus, maintains higher data quality of the released database.

Formant frequencies play an important role in the perception of speech by humans. While formant frequencies characterize voiced sounds, the transitions in formant frequencies characterize the consonants preceding and (or) the following vowels. Extraction of formant frequencies is a nontrivial task because it is not possible to directly obtain the resonances of the vocal tract system. This is because, the available speech signal is the convolution of quasi-periodic excitations and time varying vocal tract responses. Therefore, an estimate of the formant frequencies has to be obtained from the speech signal itself. We propose to use the numerator of Group-delay function to accurately extract formant frequencies from short segments of speech signals due to its property of high resolution. These formants play an important role in various speech processing applications. In this work, a detailed analysis of formant frequencies for isolated utterances of various short vowels has been performed.

For qualitative description of air quality these parameters are transformed into index numbers, by different method which describes the air quality in linguistic forms (classes/set) like clean moderate, poor or harmful. Various researchers have proposed methods for obtaining these indices and are termed as air quality Index. However these indices fail to represent the air quality correctly, when it encounters extreme values in the monitored data as it arithmetically averages them and gives an incorrect estimate of the air quality class. Moreover these indices are too sensitive at the transition boundary (clean to moderate, moderate to poor etc) as a marginal increase in value of the index (one unit) shifts the air quality class from one to another. This is due to the use of crisp set for describing these classes. Both these limitations of the present indices are demonstrated using hypothetical data set. hi order to overcome the limitations of AQI. a new index named Fuzzy Air Pollution Index (FAPI) is proposed for describing the ambient air quality. The new index uses rule based formulation and hence rules out mathematical averaging of extreme values. Since this new methodology is based on fuzzy sets, it is more robust during transition from one class to another. The application of this new methodology is demonstrated through a case study. Data for air quality parameters of Chennai city for four months is used to obtain the air quality index by both the methods and is discussed.

A multilayer feed forward network with back propagation of error learning mechanism was used to predict the body weight. Data collected from 824 Attappady Black goats in the age group of 0-12 months consisting of 370 males and 454 females were used for the study. The whole data set was partitioned into two data sets namely training data set comprising of 75 per cent data (277 and 340 records in males and females, respectively) to build the neural network model and test data set comprising of 25 per cent (93 and 114 records in males and females, respectively) to test the model. Three different moiphonietric measurements viz. chest girth, body length and height at withers were used as input variables and body weight was considered as output variable. Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) was also done using the same training and testing data sets. The prediction efficiency of both models was compared using the R2 value and Root Mean Square error (RMSE). The correlation coefficients between the actual and predicted body weights in case of .ANN were found to be positive and highly significant and ranged from 90.27 to 93.69%. The low value of RMSE and high value of R2 in case of connectionist network (RMSE: Male-1.9005. Female - 1.8434; R2: Male - 87.34, Female - 85.70) in comparison of MRA model (RMSE: Male - 2.0798, Female - 2.0836: R2: Male -84.84.

It enables the user with an interactive platform where, by varying different parameter settings, one can customize a solution. Also the execution dynamics can be followed in a step-by-step fashion. Use of generalized evolutionary optimizer allows us to solve combinatorial optimization problems using many different algorithms and to compare results visually. Here, we have tried to solve TSP using a generalized visual stochastic optimization algorithm that was initially developed for function optimization problems only.

Then the segmented signal is made to run through the existing feature extraction algorithm to extract features pertaining to the signal. After extracting features we propose an indexing technique and using this technique we populate the music database. The proposed indexing technique is based on hash table where we formulated a new method for collision resolution. Using the proposed indexing technique the database is populated and music information retrieval is performed. The proposed indexing technique had a precision of 88% and a recall of 79%.

Interest in SSL has increased in recent years, particularly because of application domains such as Software Project Development, in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images [UML diagrams], text, and bioinformatics. This first comprehensive overview of SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research. Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the research is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies and learning/forecasting based on the same. In this research focus is on semi-supervised and incremental clustering. SSL is a special form of classification. Traditional classifiers use only labeled data (feature / label pairs) to train. Labeled instances however are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain, as they require the efforts of experienced human annotators. Meanwhile unlabeled data may be relatively easy to collect, but there has been few ways to use them. Semi-supervised learning addresses this problem by using large amount of unlabeled data, together with the labeled data, to build better classifiers. Because semi-supervised learning requires less human effort and gives higher accuracy, it is of great interest both in theory and in practice.",Incremental clustering; Incremental learning; Machine learning; Semi-supervised clustering,Application domains; Benchmark experiments; Incremental clustering; Incremental learning; Labeled data; Low density; Manifold structures; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised Clustering; Semi-supervised learning; Software project; State-of-the-art algorithms; Training example; UML diagrams; Unlabeled data; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Bioinformatics; Learning systems; Research; Supervised learning,"Mulay, P.; Bharati Vidyapeeth University, Pune, India; email: Vnv2004@rediffmail.com",,,,9781601321091,,,English,"Proc.

Though there are many MOWLA models with cost minimization and DO maximization, there are very few models which have adequately addressed the issues of equity in waste load allocation models. The present paper includes equity as one of the objective and shows that by introducing equity in the objective function the solution obtained is more fair when compared to the overall cost minimization solution. However the decision maker has different satisfaction levels to different solutions. To address this uncertainty or ambiguity in a decision maker's (DM) satisfaction level, fuzzy membership functions are introduced for each objective function, thus by introducing fuzziness in the objective functions, a modeler can give a wide range solutions from which the DM can select the most satisfying solution for himself.

However, due to the open nature of RSs, new users can declare their preferences on the available items and therefore benefit from the system. Accordingly, some malicious user can enter biased profiles under fake identity in order to influence the system's behavior and produce some economic advantage for the attacker. These attacks have been termed ""shilling"" or ""profile injection"" attacks. The previous studies about attacks focus only on collaborative RSs that use correlation coefficient as a similarity function. However, today many RSs do not relay solely on this similarity measure and therefore it is important to study the effect of similarity computation phase on the various approaches. This paper discusses and analyzes the effect of similarity computation phase on the performance of many collaborative RSs under attacks. The experimental results reveal that the similarity computation phase has an important rule for decreasing to a large extent the effect of the profile injection attacks.

To deal with this problem this paper introduces an approach with a new crossover operator in GP for multiclass classification. An individual of the population will be represented using multiple trees. The GP is trained with a set of N training samples in steps. A concept of unfitness of a tree is used in order to improve genetic operations. The new crossover operator is similar to Brood Crossover in that multiple children are produced during each crossover event. However, it implicitly discovers the best possible crossover site for a subtree and attains higher fitness values while processing fewer individuals.

In the present study, tune-series and cause-effect artificial neural network models were developed to predict the monthly pan evaporation using seven important and commonly measured meteorological parameters, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours, wind speed, and dew point temperature. Recurrent Artificial Neural Network (RANN) models have been developed using ten years monthly data (1993-2002). Two different types of models were developed based on the input data set. in the fust type of model, evaporation for current tune period is predicted using previous time step evaporation (tune-series) and in the second one. the evaporation for current period is predicted by using other meteorological parameters of previous tune period (cause-effect). The determination of the network architecture, activation function, learning rate and length of data set required for the training and testing are carried out by trial and error method to optimize the connection weights and also to get the better network for prediction of evaporation. The results showed that time-series model predicted the evaporation better than cause-effect model. The correlation coefficient during validation is 0.99 for tune-series model and 0.90 for the cause-effect model. Evaporatio[i has a very complex interaction with the other meteorological parameters, which could be the reason for the inferior performance of the cause-effect model. In order to improve the performance of the cause-effect model, a booster factor is applied to the cause-effect model, which has improved the predicting ability of the model particularly the peak values.

It focuses on finding a subset of genes and a subset of experimental conditions that together exhibit coherent behavior. However, most of the existing biclustering algorithms find exclusive biclusters, which is inappropriate in the context of biology. Since biological processes are not independent of each other, many genes may participate in multiple different processes. Hence, nonexclusive bi-clustering algorithms are required for finding overlapping biclusters. In this paper, a novel possibilistic biclustering algorithm is presented to find highly overlapping biclusters of larger volume with mean squared residue lower than a predefined threshold. It judiciously incorporates the concept of possibilistic clustering algorithm into biclustering framework. The integration enables efficient selection of highly overlapping coherent biclusters with mean squared residue lower than a given threshold. The effectiveness of the algorithm, along with a comparison with other algorithms, is demonstrated on yeast gene expression data sets. In general, the proposed algorithm shows excellent performance at finding patterns in gene expression data.

In the first stage the possible text edge pixels in the source document are identified utilizing Canny edge operator. It is also possible that edges of background objects might be identified by the Canny edge operator due to complex background of the input document. In the second stage the resultant image of stage-1 is divided into into overlapping uniform sized blocks. In this stage the blocks that do not contain any edge pixel are dropped and the blocks that contain edges are analyzed as they are candidate text blocks. Based on the texture analysis of the candidate text blocks they are classified as text blocks and false text blocks. In the last stage the foreground text is extracted by performing unsupervised thresholding of the text blocks obtained from the previous stage. The proposed approach can handle document images with varying background of multiple colors and texture; and foreground text in any font and orientation. An optimal size for the blocks is selected by conducting experiments exhaustively. The proposed approach extracts on an average 77.2 % of text in the source document image. The proposed approach is compared with an existing method of foreground separation in color document images. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better.

Overlapping and touching problems, which frequently happen between two consecutive text-lines in unconstrained handwritten text documents, significantly increase complexities of text-line segmentation. In this paper we propose a novel approach based on painting technique to make foreground and background painted separately. Then the painted image is subjected to smoohing operations. Morphological operation (dilation) is employed on the foreground portion of the smooth image for making it wider and get each line as a single component. Thinning operation on the background portion of the dilated image followed by some trimming operations are performed to get candidate lines. By using the starting and end points information of the candidate lines and employing distance analysis amoung them corresponding lines with minimum distance are connected to gether to obtain segmented text-lines. We tested the proposed scheme on text pages of different scripts such as Persian, English, French, German, Greek, Bangla, Oriya, Kannada and we obtained encouraging results.

This problem will be worsening in future as demand for water would rise tremendously due to steady rise in human population. Optimal-exploitation of groundwater 'in all the areas that are getting fast depleted* is required to estimate the ground water table. Keeping this in view, different models have been developed for an Indian catchment located in North - East resion of India. Ground water studies have not been conducted much by researchers for the problematic area of Budaun district where the water table is continuously declining at a faster rate. The present study is taken up to study the ground water availability in the district. Models have been developed for prediction of water table behavior and a proper ground water recharge plan for the problematic areas can be suggested. Over the last decade, soft computing techniques like Fuzzy logic and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are increasingly used in hydrological studies. Furthermore, their computational speed in simulating and forecasting is very welcomed in real time operations. It is robust and flexible in managing real world complex systems involving uncertainty and imprecise data. Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) provides a means of converting a linguistic control strategy based on operators' knowledge into an automatic control strategy. An important feature of fuzzy set theory is the symmetry between the objective function and constraints. During tins study, a Neuro-Fuzzy approach such as ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System)- subtractive cluster method (SCM) and ANN techniques have been used for monsoon (M) and non-monsoon (NM) periods in order to estimate the ground water tables. Input data of the network are composed by past measurements of nearby inflow and rainfall, and the quantity of water which has been pumped out from ground during that specific period. Input data are fuzzified with different degrees of membership. The models are developed and applied for Budaun district in Uttar Pradesh to get the optimum output during monsoon and non-monsoon period. Models developed by SCM technique give better results than ANN technique.

The case in point is the optimization of high volume fly ash concrete (HVFAC) mix design. The model presented here consists of two stages. In the first stage, a huge database of 450 mix designs garnered through standard research publications were statistically analyzed to elicit upper and lower bounds of certain range constraints and rational ratio constraints of functional parameters. In the second stage, PSO is applied to find the quantities of cement, fly ash, and water for maximized strength of the mix. Optimal mix proportions of these important ingredients are computed corresponding to five ranges of 28 days strength by augmenting the algorithm with appropriate constraint ranges obtained in the first stage. The optimized proportions of ingredients in all the five cases are encouraging and corroborate very well with the experimental results. The outcome of this work is useful in reducing the number of trial mixtures with desired properties in the field tests.

At each concept level the whole database is compressed by converting into a directed graph which is stored in the form of an Adjacency Matrix. Further frequent pattern mining is done by performing operation on Adjacency Matrix of directed graph. The advantage of this method is that it requires only single scan of the database at each concept level for mining interesting patterns.

ICTs have the potential for promoting equitable and sustainable growth and development. There is a need to capitalize on the promise of ICTs and ensure that the opportunities to gain are spread throughout the society including rural poor women. Convergence of information and communication technologies can revolutionize access to information in Indian scenario where women are responsible for 70 per cent of the actual farm work and constitute up to 60 per cent of fanning population. To harness the potential of ICT for women farmers, it is essential to understand the constraints and factors which determine the access and use of ICT by rural women. This paper attempts to characterise the farm women who are empowered to use ICT by employing data mining algorithms for extracting pattern from real agricultural data. Primary survey data from 3 selected villages of Sonepat district of Haryana was used. It was observed that decision tree obtained using C4.5 algorithm was simple to understand and also provided maximum accuracy. On the basis of validation and discussion of the induced rules with the domain expert, it is recommended that status of education should be improved in the villages, more income opportunities should be provided to farm women and also appropriate technologies should be developed for providing ICT empowerment to farm women.

Hence in this paper we extend the concept of Triangular Spatial Relationship to Topological Triangular Spatial Relationship. The proposed can handle both spatial as well as topological relationships existing among the components present in the image which is suitable for high level image archival and retrieval. Also, we propose a new similarity measure which takes care of both spatial as well as topological relation for similarity match retrieval and is invariant to image transformations.

Rough set theory (RST) is purely based on mathematical concept, used to determine a subset of attributes called reduct which can fully characterize the knowledge of the datasets and thereby reduces dimensionality of the information system. In the paper, rule set of an information system is generated for each reduct by applying decision tree algorithm. As a next step the rule sets representing initial classifiers are pruned by removing the extraneous components resulting enhancement of accuracy in the information system. The concept of graph theory is invoked to construct the final classifier, by removing redundancy and inconsistency in the rule sets of initial classifiers. A complete and minimal set of rules is thus obtained by reducing dimensionality of the information system. The proposed method is compared with the support vector machine based classification technique to measure its efficiency.

The system consists of four modules. A real time hand tracking and extraction, feature extraction, Principle component analysis (PCA) algorithm training, and gesture recognition. First of all, real-time hand tracking and extraction algorithm is applied to trace the moving hand and to extract the hand region, and then motion analysis is performed to characterize the temporal features. Instead of capturing each frame and tracking hand movement for gesture recognition, it captures only that frame for analysis which shows least motion of the hand. That is, the frame is captured where hand stops moving for a few moments of time. This instance of the frame is where the gesture of the hand is complete. In this way the proposed technique becomes fast and memory efficient. In this proposed technique we capture 5 frames per second from video stream. After that we compare 3 continuous frames to know the frame, containing static posture shown by hand. This static posture is recognized as a hand gesture. Now it is matched with stored gesture database to know its meaning.

Improving the performance of models even when the input data size is small has got significance in dealing with classification problems. An experiment was conducted to address the issues of classification problems like size of the input instances and accuracies. Iris data with three species (Setosa, versicolor and Virginica) was used for the study. Random numbers were generated for each of four attributes (Sepal length. Sepal width, Petal length and Petal width) of the Iris species using uniform and Gaussian distributions. Input data sets of different sizes with a combination of original Iris data and random numbers for each attribute were prepared to train the decision trees and multilayer percepti on models. We observed considerable improvement in the accuracies of the decision tree models with new data sets containing random numbers than the original Iris data. Artificial neural network models, even though produced better algorithms in some cases, were proved to be inconsistent in performance with increase in the size of input instances using random numbers of either uniform or Gaussian distributions. With regard to decision tree models the proposed method provides higher average classification accuracies and a way to find better algorithms for classifying the data.

In this recommender system there exist a web of trust, which is formed on the basis of trust among agents in application domain. The personalized recommendations lists for the user agent are generated by the recommender agents that consist of Intuitionistic fuzzy sets which are computed on the basis of the extent to which the products match the profile of the user. Once the user sets the aggregated list of recommendations, user associated with that agent selects an item from the list and uses that item. On the basis of his experience with that item, he then updates his trust on his recommenders. In this way, the recommenders who provide recommendations according to the taste of user become trust worthier and vice-versa.

The term sequence is effectively preserved with the help of a novel datastructure called Status Matrix. Further the corresponding classification technique has been proposed for efficient classification of text documents. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed representation and classification methods, we have conducted extensive experiments on very large datasets including few benchmark datasets. Also the superiority of the proposed method has been established by comparing the results of the proposed method with that of very well accepted contemporary methods. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods both in terms of representation as well as classification accuracy.

Although they act upon the common water resources but very seldom there is proper coordination which is very essential for ensuring collective sustainability of such acts and interventions. Thus a hydrological framework that can keep track of the inter connection of the watersheds is essential. The present paper discusses the implementation of Web-based GIS (ArcGIS Server) to cope with all the above concerns. The integration of information is done by placing a database server and by adapting the ArcGIS Hydro data model (Arc Hydro). The data model is further enhanced to capture additional relevant information related to Soil, Landuse. Administrative area and some feature class of Hydrography data set. which are not part of Arc Hydro model. Implementation has been designed to ensure that internal GIS capabilities are shared with users in the line departments, while a Web-based platform is maintained for dissemination to external users.

We develop an efficient adaptive segmentation algorithm for color video surveillance sequence in real time, which uses four frames simultaneously and works for non-stationary background in indoor environment. At runtime, segmentation is performed by checking color intensity values at corresponding pixels P(x,y) from four frames using temporal differencing. Background is modeled with multivariate statistical partial correlation coefficient using pixel-level based approach. The segmentation starts from a seed in the form of 3×3 image blocks to avoid the noise. Usually, temporal differencing generates holes in motion objects. After subtraction, holes are filled using image fusion, which uses spatial clustering as criteria to link motion objects. The emphasis of this approach is on the robust detection of moving objects even under noise or environmental changes (indoor).

The photo realism can be brought to the 3d model by using the image based modeling methods. The image based methods impose certain assumptions on the system to reconstruct the 3D models. Video based systems on the other hand can be a very useful system for creating 3D models. It becomes more complex when perspective distortion is introduced. The challenge involved here is selecting the frames where the object of interest is present. The proposed method addresses the sampling of frames from a perspective video sequence for 3D modeling. The sampled frames are then corrected for perspective rectification. With the presence of symmetric patterns in the scene, it is possible to reconstruct the scene with photorealism.

The ready made solutions made available by software for ascertaining the design requirements of an antenna suffers from several limitations.The most noticeable is the inability of these tools to control precision and provide prediction. Moreover the custom made softwares provide 110 facility to obtain design optimization of the antenna parameters and physical layout. Also, such software solutions cannot be modified to suit extensive transmit-receive conditions observed in applications. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) offers a solution for such situations.

Accurate mathematical models neither always exist nor can they be derived for all complex environments because the domain may not be thoroughly understood. The solution consists of constructing rules that apply when input values lie within certain designer-defined categories. The major disadvantage of existing approach lies in defining the categories, called membership functions, for each input parameter - i.e. use of this method requires some form of expert knowledge in order to define these membership functions. The efficiency or accuracy of the fuzzy system is then proportional to the designer's expertise in the application area. The knowledge base in an expert system can grow incrementally and can be updated dynamically; so that the performance of an expert system can be enhanced. In this paper, a general learning method is proposed as a framework for automatically deriving membership functions and fuzzy if then rules from a setoff given training examples to rapidly build a prototype fuzzy expert system.

In conventional RFA, a group of sites (having rainfall characteristics similar to those of target site) are identified to pool information for estimation of the parameters. For this purpose, conventional methods use statistics of observed rainfall as attributes. Therefore they are ineffective in areas where data are sparse or unavailable. To address this issue, an approach is described in this paper. Large scale atmospheric variables affecting hydro-meteorology and location parameters of sites in the study area are suggested as attributes to form regions using fuzzy cluster analysis. This allows formation of effective groups of sites that can be validated for homogeneity using statistics computed from the observed rainfall. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through application to India.

The rainfall distribution over the continents is proved to be linked with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and various large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns across the globe. Hence, the basin-scale streamflow is also expected to be influenced by these large-scale climatological factors, which is investigated in this paper for the Narmada River basin. The basin scale streamflow accumulation process over a catchment is always very complex, which may not be revealed very easily. This complexity is due to the varying spatial distribution of rainfall under different storm events, complex catchment characteristics, different land-use patterns, evapo-transpiration and water retention over the basin, etc. In spite of this complexity, intensity and spatial distribution of rainfall plays a major role behind the streamflow variation, provided the other factors more or less remain constant over a sufficiently small temporal span (say monthly). Oceans happen to be the major source of moisture for the precipitation on continents. The information of El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) from the tropical Pacific Ocean and Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation (EQUIXOO) from the tropical Indian Ocean is investigated for their possible influence behind the monthly streamflow variation of Narmada River Basin. The efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool genetic programming, for the prediction of monthly streamflow through the concept of hydroclimatological approach is also studied. The results indicate that GP-derived basin scale monsoon streamflow forecasting models that use historical average of monthly streamflow and the large-scale atmospheric circulation information as inputs are quite satisfactory. The adjusted adjusted r-square value for monthly monsoon streamflow (June through October) in case of Narmada River was found to be 0.808 for training and 0.805 for testing, which is quite promising for such a complex system.

Bengali and the same system has been applied on the English SemEval 2007 affect sensing corpus containing only news headlines. A set of six emotion tags, namely, happy, sad, anger, fear, disgust and surprise, have been selected towards this emotion detection task for reliable and semi-automatic annotation of blog and news data. Conditional Random Field (CRF) based classifier has been applied for recognizing six basic emotion tags for different words of a sentence. The classifier accuracy has been improved by arranging an equal distribution of emotional tags and non- emotional tag. A score based technique has been adopted to calculate and assign tag weights to each of the six emotion tags. A sense based scoring strategy has been applied to identify sentence level emotion scores for the six emotion tags based on the acquired word level emotion tags. Sentence level emotion tagging has been carried out based on the maximum obtained sentence level emotion scores. Evaluation has been conducted for each emotion class separately on 200 test sentences from each of the Bengali blog and English news data. The system has resulted accuracies of 64.28% and 65.80% for happy. 66.42% and 60.42% for sad, 60.28% and 59.28% for anger, 72.18% and 63.60% for disgust. 67.14% and 67.54% for fear and 66.45% and 61.14% for surprise emotion classes on blog and news test data respectively.

The input parameters of design of irrigation channels are p|rone to uncertainty and it may cause failure of channels. To improve the overall reliability and cost effectiveness the optimal design of trapezoidal composite channels is performed as a chance constrained problem. The chance constrained model minimizes the cost and maximizes the probability of the channel capacity greater than the design flow. The optimization model is a highly non-linear and non-convex one having multimodal behavior. In this paper, the usefulness of two stochastic search algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are investigated to obtain the optimal solutions. The study also considers two site specific cases such as restricted top width and restricted flow depth. Both the algorithms performs equally well in giving optimal solutions and handling the additional constraints.

The estimate loss per annum due to diseases and pests in a country like India touches to billions of Rupees.

In the presented approach an ontology based expert system is designed to help farmers to take appropriate decisions and disseminate need based research find in as to millions of the fanners at a time, which is neither feasible nor practical by conventional system of extension. In conventional architecture of expert system, knowledge engineers along with domain experts build the knowledgebase manually and these expert systems are known to be working within a narrow domain of knowledge.

An image segmentation system is proposed for the segmentation of color images using fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering technique. The system uses perceptually uniform CIEL U V color space for segmentation. To speed up the segmentation algorithm and reduce the computational complexity for clustering, prominent pixels are selected. Clusters and their labels are automatically found out using FCM clustering technique. Fuzzy entropy criterion is used to evaluate an error of the system. The image pixels are classified to relevant clusters using minimum Euclidian distance. A post-processing filtering stage is applied to improve the segmentation quality. One of the advantages of this method is that it does not need to specify the priori information to segment color region besides: there is no apparently distortion or color change after segmentation. The proposed system is compared with other clustering techniques. Quantitative analysis of result is demonstrated. An application of the proposed system is presented. Experimental results show that the system has the desired ability for the segmentation of color images in a variety of vision tasks.

To determine relevant attribute, an attribute relevance measure is required. A large number of attribute relevance measures exist for discrete attributes, but they are not efficient in determining relevance of interval scaled attributes. We propose an attribute relevance measure named Mindex for interval scaled attributes. To calculate Mindex for an attribute, the dataset is efficiently partitioned based on the possible values of the attribute. Partitioning of the dataset is done with the help of micro-clustering.

Rotary furnace involves several critical parameters like Excess Air, Flame Temperature, Rotational Speed of the Furnace Drum, Melting Time, Preheat Air Temperature, Fuel Consumption and Melting Rate of the molten metal which should be controlled throughout the melting process. A complex relationship exists between these manufacturing parameters and hence there is a need to develop models which can capture this complex interrelationship and enable fast computation. In the present work, we propose a generic approach where the applicability and effectiveness of Neural Network in function approximation is used for rapid estimation of melting rate and they are integrated into the framework of Genetic Evolutionary Algorithm to form a Neuro-Genetic Optimization Technique (NGOT). A Neural Network model is trained with the experimental results. The results indicate that the NGOT heuristic converges to better solutions rapidly as it provides the values of various process parameters for optimizing the objective in a single run and thus assists for the improvement of quality in development of sound parts.

Moreover Indian handwritten languages are more critical to recognize due to their writing style, modifiers which exist above, below and in line with the character. Also two or more characters may be joined to form a conjunct character, making the task more difficult. Here in this paper, we discuss handwritten Marathi character recognition for all basic characters. Two methods were applied for extracting the features and applied to Artificial Neural Network for recognition First method of feature extraction was based on Fourier descriptors. Another new technique developed for extracting the features was based on spatial properties of the character. Results showed that the features derived using new technique gave far better recognition accuracy at a faster rate than the Fourier descriptors.

Until now, the literature has studied imbalance purely from a fault tolerance perspective where more balanced coalitions were shown to be more robust to individual robot failure. However, the effect that balancing has on the overall performance of a multi-robot team still remains unexplored. This paper attempts to identify the relationship between the imbalance level of a multi-robot team and team performance. Experiments were conducted with a simulated multi- robot soccer team to demonstrate that teams lying at the extremities of the performance spectrum tend to have a higher balance level. Latter sections of the paper describe experiments that were conducted to demonstrate how balance information may be utilized to improve overall team performance.

However, HMRF model has higher computational overhead compared to finite Gaussian mixture (FGM) model but the segmentation results are with no significant difference when applying to cleaner data. In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve the spatial constraints with a weighted neighborhood system of the HMRF model known as biased HMRF model. The segmentation problem is formulated as pixel labeling problem. The biased HMRF model parameters as well as the image labels are assumed to be unknown. This incomplete data problem is solved using the notions of expectation maximization. The expectation step obtains the MAP estimate of the image labels, assuming the availability of parameter estimates. This is achieved by ICM Algorithm. The estimated image labels are used to obtain the estimates of parameters in the maximization step. Eventually, the EM algorithm converges to the desired labelization. Experiments on both synthetic and brain MR images show that the segmentation results of our method have higher accuracy compared to existing solutions.

In literature many works are devoted to the estimation of the position of Gaussian kernels as well the computation of weights. Little focus exists on the estimation of kernel widths. Constructive learning algorithms provide a unified one stage approach for generating RBF network architectures. Positioning RBF kernels at optimal locations and appropriately fixing their widths in such networks differ from those in conventional networks. In this paper we investigate the use of different statistical measures to calculate the widths of RBF kernels and integrate them into our adaptive learning algorithm. Experimental results are presented on different benchmark datasets.

When autonomous rescue robots are involved, the pheromone through which the intelligence is shared among the rescue team of robots is largely challenged with the extent of fire in the surrounding region. Such places have higher pheromone evaporation rate and thereby the optimal path to the victim gets dissolved, resulting in a less optimal solution with increased time and effort of the rescue team.

It leads to the development of new capacities, skills, values, understanding, and preferences. Its goal is the increasing of individual and group experience. The paper starts with introduction of learning. Semi-supervised learning addresses the problem of labeled data by using large amount of unlabeled data, together with the labeled data, to build better classifiers. Because semi-supervised learning requires less human effort and gives higher accuracy, it is of great interest both in theory and in practice. The paper discusses various important approaches to semi-supervised learning such as self-training, co-training(CO). expectation maximization (EM) .CO-EM. Then the use of graph-based methods is explained. Finally the use of combination of support vector machines (SVM) and K-means clustering method is explained. The paper concludes with the proposed adaptive learning methodology.

The detected boundary is used to separate the cerebrum into two hemispheres. We tested our method over several scans collected from MRI centre and authorized brain image web sites. The performance was validated with medical experts using both normal and abnormal scans.

Non-projectivity has been analysed from two perspectives: graph properties that restrict non-projectivity and linguistic phenomenon behind non-projectivity in HyDT. Since Hindi has ample instances of non-projectivity (14% of all structures in HyDT are non-projective), it presents a case for an in depth study of this phenomenon for a better insight, from both of these perspectives. We have looked at graph constriants like planarity, gap degree, edge degree and well-nestedness on structures in HyDT.

Conventional temporal-difference (TD) methods, such as TD(λ), Q-learning and Sarsa have been used successfully with function approximation in many applications. However, it is well known that off-policy sampling, as well as nonlinear function approximation, can cause these algorithms to become unstable (i.e., the parameters of the approximator may diverge). Sutton et al. (2009a, 2009b) solved the problem of off-policy learning with linear TD algorithms by introducing a new objective function, related to the Bellman error, and algorithms that perform stochastic gradient-descent on this function. These methods can be viewed as natural generalizations to previous TD methods, as they converge to the same limit points when used with linear function approximation methods. We generalize this work to nonlinear function approximation. We present a Bellman error objective function and two gradient-descent TD algorithms that optimize it. We prove the asymptotic almost-sure convergence of both algorithms, for any finite Markov decision process and any smooth value function approximator, to a locally optimal solution. The algorithms are incremental and the computational complexity per time step scales linearly with the number of parameters of the approximator.

It stands in the core of classification methods like kernel machines, and is particularly useful for applications like searching for images that are similar to a given image or finding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, current approaches for learning similarity do not scale to large datasets, especially when imposing metric constraints on the learned similarity. We describe OASIS, a method for learning pairwise similarity that is fast and scales linearly with the number of objects and the number of non-zero features. Scalability is achieved through online learning of a bilinear model over sparse representations using a large margin criterion and an efficient hinge loss cost. OASIS is accurate at a wide range of scales: on a standard benchmark with thousands of images, it is more precise than state-of-the-art methods, and faster by orders of magnitude. On 2.7 million images collected from the web, OASIS can be trained within 3 days on a single CPU. The non-metric similarities learned by OASIS can be transformed into metric similarities, achieving higher precisions than similarities that are learned as metrics in the first place.

The second contribution is a sampling based algorithm, motivated from randomized algorithms, which solves a SVM problem by considering subsets of the dataset which are greater in size than the number of support vectors for the problem. These two ideas are combined to obtain an algorithm for SVM classification problems which performs the learning by considering only O(log n) points at a time.

We propose two multi-step linear models. The first iterates the one-step linear model, but is generally computationally complex. The second interpolates between the one-step model and the infinite-step model (which turns out to be the LSTD solution), and can be learned efficiently online. Policy evaluation on Boyan Chain shows that multi-step linear Dyna learns a policy faster than single-step linear Dyna, and generally learns faster as the number of projection steps increases. Results on Mountain-car show that multi-step linear Dyna leads to much better online performance than single-step linear Dyna and model-free algorithms; however, the performance of multi-step linear Dyna does not always improve as the number of projection steps increases. Our results also suggest that previous attempts on extending LSTD for online control were unsuccessful because LSTD looks infinite steps into the future, and suffers from the model errors in non-stationary (control) environments.",,Key elements; Model errors; Model-free algorithms; Multi-step; Nonstationary; On-line controls; On-line performance; One-step model; Planning algorithms; Policy evaluation; Single-step; Algorithms; Mathematical models,"Yao, H.; Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G2E8, Canada",,,,9781615679119,,,English,Adv.

Actor-critic reinforcement learning methods are online approximations to policy iteration in which the value-function parameters are estimated using temporal difference learning and the policy parameters are updated by stochastic gradient descent. Methods based on policy gradients in this way are of special interest because of their compatibility with function approximation methods, which are needed to handle large or infinite state spaces. The use of temporal difference learning in this way is of interest because in many applications it dramatically reduces the variance of the gradient estimates. The use of the natural gradient is of interest because it can produce better conditioned parameterizations and has been shown to further reduce variance in some cases. Our results extend prior two-timescale convergence results for actor-critic methods by Konda and Tsitsiklis by using temporal difference learning in the actor and by incorporating natural gradients, and they extend prior empirical studies of natural actor-critic methods by Peters, Vijayakumar and Schaal by providing the first convergence proofs and the first fully incremental algorithms.",,Actor critic; Actor-critic algorithm; Actor-Critic methods; Actor-critic reinforcement learning; Convergence results; Empirical studies; Function approximation; Gradient estimates; Incremental algorithm; Infinite state space; Natural gradient; Parameterizations; Policy gradient; Policy iteration; Stochastic gradient descent; Temporal difference learning; Approximation theory; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning,"Bhatnagar, S.; Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India",,,,160560352X; 9781605603520,,,English,Adv.

The ability to work with larger patch sizes allows us to deal with severe degradations including cuts, blobs, merges and vandalized documents. Our approach can also integrate document restoration and super-resolution into a single framework, thus directly generating high quality images from degraded documents.

A robust and computationally efficient approach for the localization of the different features and lesions in a fundus retinal image is presented in this paper. Since many features have common intensity properties, geometric features and correlations are used to distinguish between them. We propose a new constraint for optic disk detection where we first detect the major blood vessels and use the intersection of these to find the approximate location of the optic disk. This is further localized using color properties. We also show that many of the features such as the blood vessels, exudates and microaneurysms and hemorrhages can be detected quite accurately using different morphological operations applied appropriately. Extensive evaluation of the algorithm on a database of 516 images with varied contrast, illumination and disease stages yields 97.1% success rate for optic disk localization, a sensitivity and specificity of 95.7%and 94.2%respectively for exudate detection and 95.1% and 90.5% for microaneurysm/ hemorrhage detection.

The preliminary study provides an experimental and analytical comparison of face recognition algorithms on a plastic surgery database of 506 individuals. The experimental results indicate that existing face recognition algorithms perform poorly when matching pre and post surgery face images.

Not all face areas are subject to the same variability. Therefore decoupling the information from independent areas of the face is of paramount importance to improve the robustness of any face recognition technique. This paper presents a robust face recognition technique based on the extraction and matching of SIFT features related to independent face areas. Both a global and local (as recognition from parts) matching strategy is proposed. The local strategy is based on matching individual salient facial SIFT features as connected to facial landmarks such as the eyes and the mouth. As for the global matching strategy, all SIFT features are combined together to form a single feature. In order to reduce the identification errors, the Dempster-Shafer decision theory is applied to fuse the two matching techniques. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with the ORL and the IITK face databases. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed face recognition techniques also in the case of partially occluded faces or with missing information. © 2009 IEEE.",,Deformable object; Dempster-shafer; DS theory; Face area; Face database; Face recognition technique; Facial landmark; Global matching; Identification errors; Local strategies; Matching techniques; Missing information; Multi-classifier; SIFT Feature; Algorithms; Classifiers; Computer vision; Decision theory; Deformation; Feature extraction; Game theory; Learning systems; Face recognition,"Kisku, D.

BGM uses tf-idf values for building a semantic bipartite graph. We also introduce a cashflow Algorithm that works on the BGM to retrieve semantically relevant images from the database.

In the classification module we use support vector machines (SVMs)-here also other tool such as MLP or RBF can be used. The feature extraction module has several sub-modules each of which is expected to extract features capturing the discriminating characteristics of different areas of the input space. The classification module classifies the data based on the extracted features. The resultant architecture with MLP in feature extraction module and SVM in classification module is called NEUROSVM. The NEUROSVM is tested on twelve benchmark data sets and the performance of the NEUROSVM is found to be better than both MLP and SVM. We also compare the performance of proposed architecture with that of two ensemble methods: majority voting and averaging. Here also the NEUROSVM is found to perform better than these two ensemble methods. Further we explore the use of MLP and RBF in the classification module of the proposed architecture.

A protocol is specified from a global viewpoint, but enacted in a distributed manner by (agents playing) different roles. Each role describes a local representation. An ill-specified protocol may yield roles that fail to produce correct enactments of the protocol. Existing approaches lack a formal and comprehensive treatment of this problem. Building on recent work on declaratively specifying a protocol as a set of rules of causal logic, this paper formally defines the enactability of protocols. It presents necessary and sufficient conditions for the enactability of a protocol as well as a decision procedure for extracting correct roles from enactable protocols.

The sensing and dropping of pheromone makes it easy to understand the trail forming behavior of ants. The reinforcement tendency of pheromone following behavior ensures selection of the shortest path from a set of paths. The reinforcement tendency of pheromone following behavior also ensures a biased selection of the initially followed paths over a path, which is shorter but discovered through chance at a later point in time. Under what conditions and limits can this initial bias be reversed? In this paper, we answer this question based on a theoretical analysis of the trail forming behavior of ants. We believe our results to contribute to the overall area of understanding how to build scalable systems that evolve to solve complex problems (e.g. point covering or the traveling salesman problem) without the necessity of central command-and-control.

SWMSVQ provides better trade off between bit rate and spectral distortion performance when compared to split vector quantization (SVQ), multi stage vector quantization and in a comparable manner with switched split vector quantization (SSVQ) techniques, but this is achieved at the expense of complexity when compared to SVQ and SSVQ, memory requirements when compared to SVQ, MSVQ and SSVQ. So in order to improve the spectral distortion performance, to reduce the complexity and memory requirements of SWMSVQ the switching technique is adopted at every stage of SWMSVQ.

In contrast, super resolving a single frame low resolution image is called Example-based super-resolution (EBSR). This is achieved by recovering the missing high frequency contents from a large number of example image patches in a database. In this paper we propose a novel hybrid approach to construct a super resolved video sequence which uses the example-based method for the preprocessing of low resolution video frames as input to the multi-frame super resolution.

To achieve this objective the proposed system is divided into four components. (i) Data capture - the process of converting the signature into digital form as offline procedure. (ii) Preprocessing -This step is used to reduce noise, to apply filters, to zoom-in/zoom-out an image, etc. The system introduces fuzzy logic to improve the quality of images obtained during preprocessing which greatly enhances the accuracy of the image and significantly helps in refining the image for the process of comparing the signatures. (iii) Feature Extraction and segmentation - to obtain the boundaries and partitioning of the signature. (iv) Comparison and interpretation - matches the input signature with the templates consisting of three sample signatures. The result given as a fit ratio is obtained by thresholding the fit value. Hamming Distance algorithm is used to justify the threshold value used. The comparison process uses edge detection and pixel matching techniques. The result can be further improved by using another threshold value to compensate noises in the captured signatures. The noise would have to be introduced due to changes in the background, varying strokes, etc. The output will interpret whether the signature is accepted or rejected with appropriate explanations. Several approaches to obtain the optimal threshold value from the reference set are investigated.",Fuzzy preprocessing; Hamming distance; Segmentation; Signature interpretation; Signature verification; Stroke comparison,Fuzzy preprocessing; Segmentation; Signature interpretation; Signature verification; Stroke comparison; Computer vision; Edge detection; Feature extraction; Fuzzy logic; Hamming distance; Imaging systems; Meats; Image matching,"Chinniah, M.; Department of Computer Centre, Avinashilingam University for Women, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India",,,,1601320787; 9781601320780,,,English,"Proc.

The relation between the depth field (d) as viewed on the FPP and the corresponding Z is highly non-linear. This disagreement is higher for Z values nearer to and far away from the FPP. This behavior is mainly due to the Flat nature of the projection plane. An attempt is made in this paper to use projection planes having Flat, Cylindrical (CPP) and Spherical (SPP) geometry and to investigate the effect of the geometry of the projection plane on the above referred disagreement. Second order equations using the method of least squares are proposed to compute the depth field (Z?) for observed set of values of d, under the three methods. The percent variation of Z' from Z for the set of values of d are computed. Region Segmentation of d having ideal agreement between Z' and Z under each method is proposed.

We have named it WADIA (Watermarking Algorithm in DCT for Images with Abrupt intensity variations).This algorithm proves to be efficient especially for images with sharp intensity variations and double edges. Also this algorithm uses a Gaussian filter before detecting the edges that reduces the random noise in the image thereby limiting the false edges.

Due to resource constraints, search engines usually have difficulties in striking the right balance between time and space limitations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective model for a search engine. We suggest a hybrid design which brings together the best features that constitute a search engine. To give an overview, the whole mechanism of how a search engine works is provided. Further, the model is discussed in detail.

To improve the precision of Information Retrieval on the Web there is a need to understand the information need of the query issued by user and retrieve the good authorities and hub web pages for a particular information need implied by the query. Good authorities are those pages which are rich source of information for a specific information need. Good Hub pages are those pages which contain link to good authorities for a given information need. This paper identifies the good authorities and hub pages for a particular information need using Information Scent in HITS with query sessions mining. Information scent is used to identify the relevance of the clicked URLs in the query sessions of the user with respect to the information need of the query sessions. The approach proposed in this paper uses information need of query sessions modeled using information scent and content vector of clicked URLs in the sessions to cluster query sessions with similar information need. Each derived cluster is used in HITS algorithm to generate good hubs and authorities pages for each information need represented by cluster using information scent. The input query is then used to select the cluster that contains the high scent authorities and hub page for the information need associated with the input query. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated with an experimental study of query sessions mining of the ""Google"" Search engine web history and the experimental results shows the improvement of the Information Retrieval precision.",Authorities; Clustering; Hub; Information retrieval; Information scent; Search engine,Authorities; Clustering; Experimental studies; HITS algorithms; Hub; Information needs; Information scent; Research areas; Specific informations; User needs; Web pages; Information need; Specific information; User need; Artificial intelligence; Information services; Internet; Robot learning; Search engines; Websites; Algorithms; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Information retrieval; Information use,"Chawla, S.; Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi, Delhi, India",,,,1601320728; 9781601320728,,,English,"Proc.

The method uses color histogram as the feature, and processes each bin separately for detecting shot boundaries. The decisions from individual bins are combined later for hypothesizing the presence of shot boundaries. The method provides a certain degree of robustness against illumination and camera/object motion, as it ignores small changes in the bins. While the early fusion techniques rely on the extent of change in color information, the proposed technique relies on the number of significant changes. Experimental results successfully validate the new method and show that it can effectively detect both abrupt and gradual transitions. © 2008 IEEE.",Early fusion; Late fusion; Shot boundary detection; Video content analysis; Video segmentation,Bins; Image segmentation; Indexing (of information); Robot learning; Video recording; Visual communication; Early fusion; Late fusion; Shot boundary detection; Video content analysis; Video segmentation; Face recognition,"Mohan, C.

Methods like Maximum Entropy and Conditional Random Fields make use of features for the training purpose. These methods tend to overfit when the available training corpus is limited especially if the number of features is large or the number of values for a feature is large. To overcome this we proposed two techniques for feature reduction based on word clustering and selection. A number of word similarity measures are proposed for clustering words for the Named Entity Recognition task. A few corpus based statistical measures are used for important word selection.

The objective of the paper is to evaluate the performance of an image compression system based on fuzzy vector quantization, wavelet sub band decomposition and neural network. Vector quantization is often used when high compression ratios are required. The implementation consists of three steps. First, image is decomposed into a set of sub bands with different resolution corresponding to different frequency bands. Different quantization and coding schemes are used for different sub bands based on their statistical properties. At the second step, the wavelet coefficients corresponding to lowest frequency band are compressed by differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) and the coefficients corresponding to higher frequency bands are compressed using neural network. Finally the result of the second step is used as input to fuzzy vector quantizer. Image quality is compared objectively using peak signal to noise ratio along with the visual appearance. The simulation results show clear performance improvement with respect to decoded picture quality as compared to other image compression techniques [29-30].",,Different resolutions; Fuzzy vector quantization; High compression ratio; Image compression techniques; Peak signal to noise ratio; Performance improvements; Statistical properties; Transmission capacities; Artificial intelligence; Differential pulse code modulation; Frequency bands; Image quality; Pattern recognition; Video conferencing; Wavelet decomposition; Vector quantization,"Singh, V.; GGSIPU, New Delhi, India; email: vipulasingh@yahoo.com",,,,9781615677184,,,English,"Int.

Much of the research in recommender systems is done in solving the top-N recommendation problem where the objective is to identify a set of N items the user will most likely prefer. In this paper, we propose a weighted class based hybrid algorithm to solve this problem. Our algorithm combines the strength of both content based and collaborative filtering approaches. In this method, firstly, classes are defined by applying content based and collaborative filtering techniques on ratings data. Subsequently, user's existing profile of items is examined to determine the weightage of each class. Items are then recommended to the user on the basis of weightage attached to each class.

The main reasons are their simple structure and ease of training. Several variants of RBF learning algorithms are available for solving classification, function approximation and regression problems. In any neural network system, proper identification of architecture and their parameter initialization assumes greater significance to accomplish better performance. There have been a large number of proposals on automatic development of architectures during learning to ease out the frustration caused by trial and error based schemes to fix up the so called optimal architectures. However their focus has been confined to one objective, ie to reduce the number of RBF units. Among the several variants of constructive learning networks, Platt's Resource Allocating Network (RAN) is still one of the popular incremental learning networks that has been tried on several problem types and still research is underway to fine tune it to maximize its performance. RAN has several limitations as it is sensitive to outliers and builds larger networks resulting in memorization consequently leading poor generalization. The best part of this algorithm is its fast convergence. Hence there is substantial scope to improve its performance. In this paper, we propose two new ideas to improve the performance of RAN. In the first instance, we calculate the medoids from samples in respective pattern classes. Secondly we pick a small percentage of significant patterns based on the farthest neighbor concept. The medoids and the significant patterns are collectively used to train the RAN. The entire samples in the input space are used to test the generalization performance of the network. Benchmark datasets have been used to experiment the proposed techniques. Results reveal significant enhancement in the performance of the RAN compared to traditional RAN.",Incremental learning; Medoids; Neural networks; Resource allocating network; Significant patterns,Function approximation; Generalization performance; Incremental learning; Medoids; Neural network systems; Radial basis function neural networks; Resource allocating networks; Significant patterns; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Radial basis function networks; Network architecture,"Nagabhushan, T.N.; Department of Information Science and Engineering, Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysore-570 006, India; email: tnn@sjce.ac.in",,,,9781615677184,,,English,"Int.

(2005) proposed two formulations for maximum margin training of structured spaces: margin scaling and slack scaling. While margin scaling has been extensively used since it requires the same kind of MAP inference as normal structured prediction, slack scaling is believed to be more accurate and better-behaved. We present an efficient variational approximation to the slack scaling method that solves its inference bottleneck while retaining its accuracy advantage over margin scaling. We further argue that existing scaling approaches do not separate the true labeling comprehensively while generating violating constraints. We propose a new max-margin trainer PosLearn that generates violators to ensure separation at each position of a decomposable loss function. Empirical results on real datasets illustrate that PosLearn can reduce test error by up to 25% over margin scaling and 10% over slack scaling. Further, PosLearn violators can be generated more efficiently than slack violators; for many structured tasks the time required is just twice that of MAP inference.

These meta-tags are essential to text-based image search engines to improve their search relevance. Traditional supervised scheme is not suitable for this task because it needs too much manual labelling efforts and yet is hard to scale to a large number of object categories. Notice that in the search scenarios, the meta-tagging does not need to be perfect to help improve relevance because the available text tags and user click-through logs can partially rectify the inaccurate information. A weakly supervised scheme would be ideal when only sporadic labelled examples are exploited in spite of the expected loss in tagging accuracy. In this paper, we develop a novel weakly semi-supervised ensemble classifier trained based on a co-training framework for this tagging last In essence the meta-tags are recursively propagated from the sparsely tagged examples to the un-tagged ones.

The problem is definitely solvable if there are multiple observations. In this paper we show that one can perceive the depth in the scene even from a single observation. We use the inhomogeneous reverse heat equation to obtain an estimate of the blur, thereby preserving the depth information characterized by the defocus. However, the reverse heat equation, due to its parabolic nature, is divergent. We stabilize the reverse heat equation by considering the gradient degeneration as an effective stopping criterion. The amount of (inverse) diffusion is actually a measure of relative depth. Because of ill-posedness we propose a graph-cuts based method for inferring the depth in the scene using the amount of diffusion as a data likelihood and a smoothness condition on the depth in the scene.

This paper presents a comparative study of the performance from the iris identification using log-Gabor, Haar wavelet, DCT and FFT based features. Our experimental results suggest that the performance from the Haar wavelet and log Gabor filter based phase encoding is the most promising among all the four approaches considered in this work. Therefore the combination of these two matchers is most promising, both in terms of performance and the computational complexity.

The action basis is built using eigenanalysis of walking sequences of different people. Given the limited amount of training data, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is used to perform recognition. We propose the use of the average-template with multiple features, first used in speech recognition, to belter capture the intra-class variations for each action. We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm using our low dimensional feature to robustly recognize human actions. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant recognition can be performed by using a simple data fusion of two orthogonal views. For the actions that are still confusable, a temporal discriminative weighting scheme is used to distinguish between them. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by conducting experiments on the multi-view IXMAS dataset of persons performing various actions. © 2008 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Feature extraction; Gesture recognition; Image processing; Object recognition; Pattern recognition; Data sets; Dynamic Time Warping; Eigen-analysis; Feature vector; Human actions; Human-action recognition; Intra-class variations; Invariant recognition; Low dimensional; Multi views; Multiple features; Orthogonal views; Spatio-Temporal; Training data; Weighting schemes; Speech recognition,"Cherla, S.; Siemens Corporate Technology, SISL, Bangalore, India; email: srikanth.cherla@siemens.com",,,,9781424423408,,,English,"IEEE Comput.

Models are being sought at different scales of biological organisation namely: sub-cellular, cellular, tissue, organ, organism and ecosystem; with a view of identifying how different components are connected together, how they are controlled and how they behave when functioning as a system. Except for very simple biological processes, system identification from first principles can be extremely difficult. This has brought into focus automated techniques for constructing models using data of system behaviour. Such techniques face three principal issues: (1) The model representation language must be rich enough to capture system behaviour; (2) The system identification technique must be powerful enough to identify substantially complex models; and (3) There may not be sufficient data to obtain both the model's structure and precise estimates of all of its parameters. In this paper, we address these issues in the following ways: (1) Models are represented in an expressive subset of first-order logic. Specifically, they are expressed as logic programs; (2) System identification is done using techniques developed in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). This allows the identification of first-order logic models from data. Specifically, we employ an incremental approach in which increasingly complex models are constructed from simpler ones using snapshots of system behaviour; and (3) We restrict ourselves to ""qualitative"" models. These are non-parametric: thus, usually less data are required than for identifying parametric quantitative models. A further advantage is that the data need not be precise numerical observations (instead, they are abstractions like positive, negative, zero, increasing, decreasing and so on). We describe incremental construction of qualitative models using a simple physical system and demonstrate its application to identification of models at four scales of biological organisation, namely: (a) a predator-prey model at the ecosystem level; (b) a model for the human lung at the organ level; (c) a model for regulation of glucose by insulin in the human body at the extra-cellular level; and (d) a model for the glycolysis metabolic pathway at the cellular level. ©2008 Ashwin Srinivasan and Ross D.

Our approach described in this paper makes use of training data extracted from raw text, which makes it an unsupervised approach. The unambiguous V - P - N and N1 - P - N2 tuples of the training corpus TEACH the system how to resolve the attachments in the ambiguous V - N1 - P - N2 tuples of the test corpus. A graph based approach to word sense disambiguation ( WSD) is used to obtain the accurate word knowledge. Further, the data sparsity problem is addressed by (i) detecting synonymy using the wordnet and (ii) doing a form of inferencing based on the matching of V s and N s in the unambiguous patterns of V - P - NP , NP 1 - P - NP2. For experimentation, Brown Corpus provides the training data andWall Street Journal Corpus the test data. The accuracy obtained for PP-attachment resolution is close to 85%. The novelty of the system lies in the flexible use of WSD and DSR phases.",,Data sparsity problems; Prepositional phrase; Semantic information; Training corpus; Training data; Unsupervised approaches; Word-sense disambiguation; World knowledge; Artificial intelligence,"Deptt. of Computer Sc. and Engg, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India",,,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

Traditionally initial modes are chosen randomly. As a consequence of that, the clustering results cannot be generated and repeated consistently. In this paper we present an approach to compute initial modes for K-mode clustering algorithm to cluster categorical data sets. Here, we utilize the idea of Evidence Accumulation for combining the results of multiple clusterings. Initially, n F - dimensional data is decomposed into a large number of compact clusters; the K-modes algorithm performs this decomposition, with several clusterings obtained by N random initializations of the K-modes algorithm. The modes thus obtained from every run of random initializations are stored in a Mode-Pool, PN. The objective is to investigate the contribution of those data objects/patterns that are less vulnerable to the choice of random selection of modes and to choose the most diverse set of modes from the available Mode-Pool that can be utilized as initial modes for the K-mode clustering algorithm. Experimentally we found that by this method we get initial modes that are very similar to the actual/desired modes and gives consistent and better clustering results with less variance of clustering error than the traditional method of choosing random modes.",,Categorical data; Clustering accuracy; Clustering process; Clustering results; Evidence accumulation; K-modes algorithm; Multiple clusterings; Partitional clustering algorithm; Artificial intelligence; Lakes; Clustering algorithms,"National University of Ireland Galway, Department of Information Technology, Galway, Ireland",,,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

One of the major causes for the degradation in the performance of ASR systems is due to inter-speaker variations. These variations are commonly modeled by a pure scaling relation between spectra of speakers enunciating the same sound. Therefore, current state-of-the art ASR systems overcome this problem of speaker-variability by doing a brute-force search for the optimal scaling parameter. This procedure known as vocal-tract length normalization (VTLN) is computationally intensive. We have recently used Scale-Transform (a variation of Mellin transform) to generate features which are robust to speaker variations without the need to search for the scaling parameter. However, these features have poorer performance due to loss of phase information. In this paper, we propose to use the magnitude of Scale-Transform and a pre-computed ""phase""-vector for each phoneme to generate speaker-invariant features.

It has been shown in the literature that the point of convergence and motion of a swarm of autonomous mobile agents can be controlled by using cyclic pursuit laws. In cyclic pursuit, there exists a predefined cyclic connection between agents and each agent pursues the next agent in the cycle. In this paper we generalize this idea to a case where an agent pursues a point which is the weighted average of the positions of the remaining agents. This point correspond to a particular pursuit sequence. Using this concept of centroidal cyclic pursuit, the behavior of the agents is analyzed such that, by suitably selecting the agents' gain, the rendezvous point of the agents can be controlled, directed linear motion of the agents can be achieved, and the trajectories of the agents can be changed by switching between the pursuit sequences keeping some of the behaviors of the agents invariant. Simulation experiments are given to support the analytical proofs.",,Agent swarm; Autonomous mobile agent; Cyclic connections; Cyclic pursuit; Linear motion; Rendezvous point; Swarm Intelligence; Weighted averages; Artificial intelligence,"GCDSL, Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India",,,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

Feature based maps provide more consistent representation by implicitly considering correlation between cells. But they are sparse due to sparseness of features in a typical environment.

When applied to real world problems though, MDPs exhibit considerable implicit redundancy, especially in the form of symmetries. Existing model minimization methods do not exploit this redundancy due to symmetries well. In this work, given such symmetries, we present a time-efficient algorithm to construct a functionally equivalent reduced model of the MDP. Further, we present a Real Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP) algorithm which obviates an explicit construction of the reduced model by integrating the given symmetries into it. The RTDP algorithm solves the reduced model, while working with parameters of the original model and the given symmetries. As RTDP uses its experience to determine which states to backup, it focuses on parts of the reduced state set that are most relevant. This results in significantly faster learning and a reduced overall execution time. The algorithms proposed are particularly effective in the case of structured automorphisms even when the reduced model does not have fewer features. We demonstrate the results empirically on several domains.",,Explicit constructions; Markov Decision Processes; Minimization methods; Original model; Overall execution; Real-time dynamic programming; Real-world problem; Time-efficient; Artificial intelligence; Dynamic programming; Markov processes; Redundancy; Algorithms,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India",,,10450823,,,,English,IJCAI Int.

These slabs are further rolled into sheets according to specialized customer requirements. Quality issues that may arise during continuous casting have significant downstream impact. One aspect of quality deterioration is the formation of surface cracks on solidifying slabs. A novel approach is described here to automatically recognize and classify these cracks according to intensity and type in real time, from slab surface images captured on cameras at the production line. First Canny edge detection is used to locate all possible edges in the image; the extracted edges are passed through the Hough transform to identify near-straight lines among them. The third and critical step uses the Relative Fuzzy Connectedness approach to segment cracks that are invariably aligned along these straight lines. The isolation of cracks from clutter caused by scaling, depressions and other deformities is a major problem. As extent of clutter varies significantly across images, reliable automatic filtration becomes unattainable using crisp threshold-dependent methods.

Inductive transfer is being applied in improving the generalization performance on a classification task using the models learned on some related tasks. In this paper, we show a method of making inductive transfer for text classification more effective using Wikipedia. We map the text documents of the different tasks to a feature space created using Wikipedia, thereby providing some background knowledge of the contents of the documents. It has been observed here that when the classifiers are built using the features generated from Wikipedia they become more effective in transferring knowledge. An evaluation on the daily classification task on the Reuters RCV1 corpus shows that our method can significantly improve the performance of inductive transfer. Our method was also able to successfully overcome a major obstacle observed in a recent work on a similar setting. © 2007 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Education; Learning systems; Robot learning; Background knowledge (BK); Feature spaces; Generalization performance; International conferences; Machine-learning; Reuters (CO); Text classification (TC); Text documents; Wikipedia; Text processing,"Banerjee, S.; Hwlett-Packard Labs, Bangalore, India; email: somnath.banerjee@hp.com",,,,0769530699; 9780769530697,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

Many enterprises maintain several databases independently to serve different purposes. There could be an implicit association among various parts of such data. In this paper, we investigate a mechanism to generate Association Rules (ARs) between the sets of values which are subsets of domains of attributes occurring in relations present in different databases. In our approach, the relevant databases, relations and attributes are identified using knowledge, multiple navigation paths are generated using data dictionary, a structure is constructed which semantically partitions the resultant relation using this navigation paths.

Feature selection methods in turn use these representations to select important features for a category. Although many feature weighting schemes are available, none truly exploited the category-related information to capture the importance of the term with respect to its presence or absence in the category level rather than only in the document level. In this paper, we propose two new methods of capturing category-related information, which were combined with four feature weighting methods to produce enhanced performance. The effectiveness of these enhancements is demonstrated by using these schemes to calculate the term weight of the documents. We have compared their performances with their original versions when applied in text classification. Encouraged by these results, we introduce a new feature weighting scheme, which takes care of the category-related information and performs impressively in text classification.

The system initially trained for raw rice uses both colour and geometrical attributes of each grain. A rule-based classifier distinguishes grains into ten refractions with small number of inputs. An exhaustive-input artificial neural network (ANN) classifier provides results in a better way. Initial results show the advantages and performance of both the approaches with high degree of classification accuracy for common refractions and grades.

However, due to support-dependency of ARD techniques, numerous low support but extremely important genetic relationships get overlooked. Lowering of threshold support generates large number of patterns and rules that create difficulty in detecting the right set of rules appropriate for biological interpretation. The present work introduces a new methodology for mining significant causal genetic relationships using a different metric called cohesion. Some techniques have also been suggested to reduce count of rules by focusing at the more informative ones while discarding others. Experiments with several gene expression datasets reveal that cohesion-based mining is much more effective as well as pragmatic than its support-based counterpart in mining high-confidence and significant genetic associations.

Here, we present design and development of an user-friendly interactive knowledge acquisition system having the facilities of adding, viewing, modifying and deleting both types of knowledge (i.e. textual and pictorial) for identification and control of pulse crop diseases. The system assists domain experts and knowledge engineers to feed knowledge in the knowledge base in a structured form and in maintaining consistency of the encoded knowledge. The basic structure of the knowledge base is designed by the knowledge engineer on the basis of different types of knowledge needed for the identification and control of diseases in pulse crops. However, this structure can be used for other crops also.

Basic symbols are identified as the fundamental unit of segmentation in this paper which are recognized by neural classifier. We have used three feature extraction techniques namely, histogram of projection based on mean distance, histogram of projection based on pixel value and Vertical Zero crossing . These feature extraction techniques are very much powerful to extract feature of even distorted characters.

The CA based classifier is employed to diagnose the faulty module of a circuit under test (CUT). It performs faster diagnosis with one to two order of magnitude reduction of memory overhead over that required for conventional fault dictionary based diagnosis scheme. The desired classifier for a CUT is evolved through efficient evolution of genetic algorithm (GA).

This high complexity limits its applicability for data mining problems that deals with very large databases.

In ACO, optimal values of the parameters are critical to balance intensification and diversification. The proposed hybrid multipath algorithm (ACO-H) uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the ACO parameters for enhancing the exploration of the search space.

The fields are modeled as an intensity function. The intensity function peaks at locations from obstacles that are at the obtained sensor distance after incorporating visibility constraints. Intensity functions corresponding to various sensor readings are superposed and the areas with highest intensity are the best location/pose estimates of the robot. The proposed method can be viewed in two ways. Firstly, it is perceived as a faster alternative to traditional global localization methods based on Markov and particle filters approaches. Secondly it can be viewed as an aid to quick Markov or particle filter localization. Markov localization involves belief computation of robots position at all cells in a discretized representation of the map of the environment. Particle filters or Monte Carlo methods initialize particles across the whole map. This method can quickly say those cells in the map where belief computations need to be done or those places where particles need to be initialized instead of doing it across the entire terrain.

Grammatical Inference is the process of learning of grammars and languages from data. Greibach et al (1992) introduced a subclass of context-free grammars called single tree grammars with applications in logic data base theory. An inference algorithm has been proposed by Mäkinen (2000) for inferring a restricted class of linear single tree languages generated by linear single tree grammars. Here based on the technique of Sempere and Nagaraja (1998) we give an algorithm to learn linear single tree languages with positive structural information as input to the algorithm. The advantage is that the language class includes the class inferred by the Mäkinen's algorithm. We extend single tree notion to linear simple matrix languages (Ibarra 1970) and point out the applicability of our algorithm to learn these languages.

Complexity involved in UCP is high because of the non-linear constraints involved and the complexity further increases when ramp rates are considered. Further, in Unit Commitment, reliability considerations are reflected in the form of hourly Spinning Reserve (SR) Capacity. Spinning reserve, more often than not, is treated as a soft constraint by using penalty methods which don't guarantee a strict compliance of the minimum hourly reserve constraint throughout the schedule period. This paper presents Hybrid Stochastic Search (HSS) approaches, HSS Unit Commitment (HSSUC) and HSSUC with Ramp rates (HSSUCR) for solving Unit Commitment with hard reserve constraints. The proposed algorithms have been tested on standard test systems. These algorithms provide low-cost solutions with less computational effort, even while ensuring strict compliance of constraints.

SVM has been successfully used for many machine learning applications like text categorization, email filtering etc. This drives us to use it for link detection system. While SVM captures the necessary unigram-related information without any regard to word dependency, term dependency needs to be captured. We have proposed a technique of creating a Context-Graph that performs this function successfully. One of the documents given for link detection is used for training the SVM and the other document is used for testing the closeness.

Our approach is based on behavior based algorithms for robots. Our main behaviors are navigation to a specified target point, obstacle avoidance, maximizing coverage satisfying the communication constraint. The multi robotic coverage uses the potential field method of defining potential field zones in the map. Target position is the least potential point. The obstacles have higher potential. By the laws of physics any body tries to go from a high potential zone to a lower potential zone. We try to capture this idea and implement it on the robot. The advantage of this method is that it treats each robot as an independent entity obeying the three behaviors. This reduces the multi robotic navigation algorithm to a single robotic navigation problem satisfying the constraints.

Their results look very promising. Concrete is a heterogeneous material with complex behavior and is not amenable for crisp mathematical predications. Most of the inferences regarding the material behavior are formulized after going through experimental results that consists of equipment imprecision, tolerances and human factor. The analytical modeling of concrete using traditional methods is arduous and not robust. Further, the mathematical models developed using traditional statistical methods are generally based on assumed relationships and do not have the true predicting capability outside the experimental domain used for their development. Unlike traditional parametric methods, the soft computing methods do not assume a relationship between various parameters and concrete performance. The relationship is rather generated from the experimental data provided to build and train the model. This paper makes a modest attempt to present an elaborative discussion on the applications of soft computing techniques in concrete technology and their advantages. The published research work pertaining to applications of constituents of soft computing in general and hybrid systems in particular are discussed.

For small data sets, we show through experiments that (a) Lanckriet's bound is loose and (b) estimated errors using bootstrap and LOO technique are not reliable as LKMs are unstable algorithms (large variation in errors under small perturbation of learning data set). To obtain good error estimate for the generalization error, we present a bootstrap technique that combines the proposed leave-one-out-kernel (LOOK) algorithm for estimating the generalization error for the optimal kernel matrix learning problem.

The parameters, to calculate the importance of given amplitude segment approximately, are estimated by incomplete beta function and probability of occurrence of the amplitude segment. Various aspects of proposed techniques are discussed and experimentally validated. Its efficacy is investigated by comparison with Nyquist based sampling.

However, the success of agent-based system is subject to the adoption of effective agents' cooperation that would be needed to share expertise for achieving goals of Multi-agent systems. To effectively handle cooperation among agents, a modeling tool is required that an agent could use as a decisive support for partner selection in order to collaborate or delegate a task. This paper presents an application of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs), which are useful tool for simulating and analyzing dynamic systems, to recognize a suitable partner from its agent base and to prevent possible failures of others. The evaluation for partner choice is based on the two important features of agents namely service quality and its computation state. Service quality of a service provider agent could be evaluated by characteristics namely accuracy, relaibility, and availability while computational state is an indicator of its stress in terms of tasks at hand and its capability to process those tasks.

It has been shown that fuzzy quadtree path planner offers a significant reduction in storage space and computation time, which are critical for low cost UAV applications. In addition to that, the optimal path predicted by the fuzzy quadtree planner was smoothened by a proposed trajectory smoother, taking vehicle's kinematic constraint into account.

Mammography is a medical imaging technique that combines, low-dose radiation and high-contrast, high-resolution film for examination of the breast and screening for breast cancer. The aim of a screening mammogram is to detect a tumor that cannot be physically detected. This paper proposes a method for detection of tumor using Watershed Algorithm, and further classifies it as benign or malignant using Watershed Decision Classifier (WDC). The technique consists of four phases namely, the pre-processing of image, detecting the presence of tumor, creation of the data base and finally classifying and categorizing them into two groups such as Cancerous or Benign. Experimental results show that this method performs well with the classification accuracy reaching nearly 88.38%.",Classification; Digital mammography; Random forest; Segmentation; Watershed algorithm,Classification (of information); Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Oncology; Random processes; Digital mammography; High-resolution films; Watershed algorithms; Mammography,"Vibha, L.; Dept. of CSE, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bangalore University, Bangalore, 560001, India; email: vibhal1@jediffmail.com",,,,9780889866317,,,English,Proc.

We examine two aspects that distinguish GMP from standard multiclass problems: a) the performance metric of interest in GMP may not be strict accuracy; accuracy within a bandwidth of the desired class may be permissible in some situations, and b) the ambiguity expressed by the classifier may simply reflect the underlying ambiguity in the class labeling itself. To deal with these issues, we extend the existing rejection schemes for multiclass problems to cover the GMP case. Firstly, we take the existing rejection schemes and calibrate them to optimize measures other than strict accuracy. Secondly, we present an extension to the wellknown dual threshold scheme to deal with GMP.

Examples of such sources include hostile mobile targets in a battlefield and moving fire-fronts that are created in forest fires. The coordination scheme used by the pursuers is based on an algorithm called the glowworm optimization algorithm (GSO) that finds multiple optima of multimodal objective functions. We briefly describe the various phases of the GSO algorithm and the modifications that are required to implement the algorithm in a set of physical robots. For the case where the positions of the pursuers and the moving source are collinear, we present a theoretical result that provides anupper bound on the relative speed of the mobile source below which the pursuers succeed in chasing the source. We use simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm in chasing mobile signal sources. In particular, we present simulation results for single and two source cases, respectively, where each source moves in a circular trajectory and at constant angular speed. In the case where the positions of the pursuers and the moving source are non-collinear, we use numerical experiments to determine an upper bound on the relative speed of the mobile source below which the pursuers succeed in chasing the source.

Initial experiments reveal that rough set theory facilitated in feature selection, without decreasing the quality of obtained clusters. Cluster quality is judged on two validity indices of Root Mean Square Standard Deviation and Dunn's Index. These validity indices are computed for datasets with full features and rough set based selected subset of features. Further graph is plotted on these validity indices with number of clusters, to find the partitioning that best fits the underlying data. Optimum number of clusters obtained with full features and selected subset is compared with the number of classes already present in the dataset to confirm that this process resulted in obtaining the same number of clusters.

The knowledge sharing protocol determines the inclusion and exclusion of knowledge volunteers and regulates the discussion within the community. By rationally exchanging questions and answers in a debate fashion, knowledge is explored across knowledge volunteers until a definite conclusion is reached. The initial predicates of world knowledge are represented as a thoroughly classified ontology based on the knowledge models of Nyaya Sastra. Besides classification, the knowledge volunteers are grouped according to a degree of trust, using which the other volunteers accept or reject the knowledge proposed by any proponent. During discussion, the proponent refers to a special relation, invariable concomitance, between the concepts to explain the inference to other opponents. The opponent analyses the presence of the above relation in its very own knowledge base and the relevant defects obtained are rewarded to the proponent. In this fashion, autonomous knowledge volunteers gain new and valid knowledge, using which they arrive at new conclusions in the future. The system acquires facts, descriptions, and arguments by allowing participants to construct and fill in natural language templates. It employs methods of clarifying entered knowledge and allows participants to validate knowledge and in turn each other.

While several methods of data editing procedures exist, in recent times, the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for editing purposes has been increasingly recognized. Non-response and interchange errors as well as their joint effects are frequently occurring editing situations. In this study, out of these three situations, editing under non-response errors has been considered. Evaluation of applications of ANN for data editing has been done by considering agricultural census data of Maharashtra state, India. The results revealed that ANNs do provide a viable alternative method for editing purposes.

A typical ASR system consists of two major blocks, viz., feature extractor and pattern classifier. The feature extractor does the job of mapping speech signals into speaker-specific features whereas pattern classifier builds up speaker-specific models from the features. An ASR system will be efficient if the proper speaker-specific features are extracted. Most of the state-of-the-art ASR systems use the same features which have been used in speech recognition research.

Fuzzy logic control deals with reasoning algorithms used to emulate human thinking and decision making in machines. In present research work, Fuzzy PI, Fuzzy P + Fuzzy I and Fuzzy P + Fuzzy I + Fuzzy D controllers have been implemented in a level control system in real time. NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS™ (USA) based hardware and software tools (LabVIEW™) were used for precise and accurate acquisition, measurement and control. The real time implementation of the Fuzzy PI controller has been carried out in two configurations: simple feedback and cascade control configuration. In cascade control configuration Fuzzy PI has been implemented only in the primary loop. The secondary loop has been tuned using the conventional PI controller.

The number of bits required for storing four bases of any DNA sequence is two, but efficient algorithms have pushed this limit lower. With the constant decrease in prices of memory and communication channel bandwidth, one often doubts the need of such compression algorithms. The algorithm discussed in this paper hence not only compresses the DNA sequence, but also allows one to generate finite length sequences, which can be used to find approximate pattern matches. DNA sequences are mainly of two types, Repetitive and Non-Repetitive. The compression technique used is meant for the non-repetitive parts of the sequence, where we make use of the fact that a DNA sequence consists of only 4 characters. The algorithm achieves bit/base ratio of 1.3 - 1.4(dependant on the database), but more importantly one of the stages of the algorithm can be used for efficient discovery of approximate patterns.

The algorithms are found to produce more structural varieties and unique trees when compared to other standard tree generation algorithms. The user can have control over the tree structures. The new algorithm and its variants can be used for the evolutionary design problems of Type III involving both variable structure and variable parameters. For those problems importance has been given to maintain diversity in the structures and parameters.

Study and analysis of each tool is extremely useful in the tool condition monitoring process. Determination of optimal cutting conditions and prediction of expected tool life is gaining momentum. Various measurable parameters and their correlative results are essential in taking steps to make the tool health monitoring process on-line and minimize downtime in productive environments. Condition monitoring of the cutting tools is very important as the process capability and process parameters may be evaluated based on the condition of the tool. Wear of the tool tip generates poor surface finish and an unexpected tool failure may damage the tool, work piece and the machine tool. Advanced manufacturing demands an optimal machining process with proper control of machining parameters. Efforts are on to make control of most of the machining parameters on-line. Many problems that affect optimization are related to the diminished machine performance caused by worn out tools. One of the most promising tool condition monitoring technique is based on the analysis of acoustic emission (AE) signals. Generation of the AE signals in the cutting zone makes them sensitive to changes in the cutting process. Experiments were conducted on select specimens of steel using select varieties of cutting tools inserts on a high speed lathe for some specific cutting conditions. The AE signal analysis is carried out using, ring down count (RDC), rise time (RTT), event duration (EDT), energy (ENT) and peak amplitude (PA).",AE; EDT; ENT; PA; RCT; RTT,AE; EDT; ENT; RCT; RTT; Artificial intelligence; Condition monitoring; Machining centers; Optimization; Polyamides; Cutting tools,"Srinidhi, R.; Department Mechanical Engineering, Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysore, Karnataka, India",,,,9781601320254,,,English,"Proc.

Here we use purely corpus based machine learning techniques. The methods we present are completely language independent - no language specific knowledge is used. We describe our experiments on ten of the major Indian languages including Assamese, Bengali (Bangla), Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. We have conducted our experiments on the DoE-CIIL corpora. We have also worked on the newspaper corpus forming part of the LERC-UoH Telugu corpus developed by us. We have used several machine learning techniques including naive Bayes classifier, k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier and SVMs. We have used one-vs.-all SVMs for multi-classification with 3-fold Cross Validation in all cases. We see that SVMs out-perform other classifiers. We describe our experiments with soft-margin linear SVMs as well as kernel based SVMs using polynomial and Radial Basis Function kernels. Kernel based SVMs have not performed significantly better than linear SVMs. There is not much work done in text categorization in Indian languages. Text categorization in Indian languages is challenging as Indian languages are very rich in morphology, giving rise to a very large number of word forms and hence very large feature spaces. We show how Mutual Information between features and categories can be used to achieve substantial reduction in the dimensionality of the feature space without reducing the performance. In fact many terms actually act as noise and we show that pruning such terms from the feature space actually enhances the performance. The paper is written in tutorial style and adequate background material is included on text categorization as also on the machine learning techniques used, for the benefit of readers who may not be familiar with these.

It is interesting to discover exceptions, as they challenge the existing knowledge and often lead to the growth of knowledge in new directions. Discovering exceptions from voluminous data sets still remains a great challenge. In Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), it is also significant to extract the knowledge in a form that is flexible and efficient enough for approximate reasoning. A Censored Production Rule (CPR) is a special kind of knowledge structure that is represented as an augmented production rule of the form: If P Then D Unless C, where C (Censor) is an exception to rule. If P Then D part of CPR holds frequently while Unless C part holds rarely. Discovery of CPRs not only provides a computational mechanism to exhibit variable precision logic but also results in the discovery of a set of rules of considerably reduced size. In this paper, a Parallel Genetic Algorithm approach is suggested for automated discovery of Censored Production Rules. The parallel Genetic Algorithm involves both data and control parallelism. A fitness function that incorporates the constraints of CPRs, is proposed.

A ready-to-reconstitute formulation of this product was developed to overcome the problem of limited shelf life. As the new product was intended for room temperature storage it was expected that during storage and marketing, the product might undergo variable temperature exposure making prediction of shelf life a difficult task. It was therefore envisaged to monitor deteriorative changes in Basundi mix stored at various temperatures (10, 25 and 40°C) using quality indices like pH, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), bulk density (BD) and insolubility index (II) which served as the input parameters for model building. The output parameters were sensorily evaluated flavour and total sensory score, which could be related to storage life of the product. A multilayer feed forward neural network model with back propagation algorithm was used for predicting shelf life of Basundi mix employing ANN tool box of MATLAB software. A number of ANN approaches were used to train the network out of which Bayesian regularization algorithm provided stable and consistent results for the given dataset. A total of 140 observations were used and the prediction performance was judged on the basis of percent root mean square error. Relatively lower magnitude of percent root mean square error (%RMS 3.72 for flavour and 1.85 for total sensory score) indicated an excellent fit.

Many of the cardiac problems are visible as distortions in the electrocardiogram (ECG).In this paper the authors have attempted to automate this process of cardiac disease diagnosis making use of artificial neural networks. Arrhythmia is the specific cardiac disease dealt with in this paper. The three classes of ECG signals are Normal, Fusion and Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC). Authors propose to use DCT (discrete cosine transform) as a novel approach for feature extraction. The most important DCT coefficients, about thirty, are identified and used to train an artificial neural network. Various network topologies like MLP, RBF and SOFM are also evaluated. The MLP with one hidden layers with 15 neurons for hidden was found to give best results. The system showed accuracy of more than 98.5% and was tested for various noise level conditions.

The Bengali, Hindi and Telugu NEs are divided into Transliteration Units (TUs) that have the pattern C+M, where C represents a vowel or a consonant or conjunct and M represents the vowel modifier or matra. An English word is divided into TUs that have the pattern Cz.ast;Vz.ast;, where C represents a consonant and V represents a vowel. The system learns mappings automatically from the bilingual training sets of NEs, particularly person and location names. The output of this mapping process is a decision-list classifier with collocated TUs in the source language and their equivalent TUs in collocation in the target language along with the probability of each decision obtained from the training set. Evaluation of the proposed models in terms of Word Agreement Ratio (WAR) and Transliteration Unit Agreement Ratio (TUAR) demonstrated that the modified joint source-channel model performs best for Bengali, Hindi and Telugu to English transliterations. All the transliteration models have been tested for English to Bengali transliteration and it has been observed that the modified joint source-channel performs best in terms of evaluation parameters, WAR and TUAR. The Bengali to English (B2E) and English to Bengali (E2B) transliteration systems have also been tested with the help of linguistic knowledge in the form of conjuncts and diphthongs in Bengali and their corresponding representations in English.

Such zero-crossings supposedly form a raw primal sketch edge map of the external world in the primary visual cortex of the brain. On the basis of the recent physiological evidences, we have modified the existing center-surround model of the receptive field of the Ganglion cells. and consequently observed the importance of the higher derivatives in zero crossing detection particularly in the presence of noise. Zero crossing points, thus generated, produce a better primal sketch in the form of a halftone image. Apart from the edge information these sketches also retain shading information of the original image in the form of zero-crossing density variation. We have also observed that an optimal amount of noise contamination produces better representation of the original image. We show that this phenomenon is similar in nature to that of SR phenomenon observed in psychophysical experiments.

The performance of manually operated and human monitored systems are mainly dependent on the operating personnel. Production process and optimal performance of automated process can further be improved if human intelligence and observations can be inbuilt into a machine system.

Tool monitoring is becoming important as most of the times reduced performance is attributed to worn out tools. Acoustic Emission (AE) signal analysis has emerged as a promising tool condition monitoring technique. AE Signal parameters such as Ring Down Count (RDC), Rise Time (RTT), Event Duration (EDT), Energy (ENT) and Peak Amplitude (PA) have been widely used by various researchers in tool status monitoring.

Questions such as ""Is she really who she claims to be?,"" ""Is this person authorized to use this facility?"" are routinely being posed in a variety of scenarios ranging from issuing a driver's licence to gaining entry into a country. Biometric recognition refers to an automatic recognition of individuals based on a feature vector(s) derived from their physiological and/or behavioral characteristic. Biometric recognition systems should provide a reliable personal recognition schemes to either confirm or determine the identity of an individual. Applications of such a system include computer systems security, secure electronic banking, mobile phones, credit cards, secure access to buildings, health and social services. By using biometrics a person could be identified based on ""who she/he is"" rather than ""what she/he has"" (card, token, key) or ""what she/he knows"" (password, PIN).

Over the years, efforts have been made to improve the detection and recognition performance of the biometric systems, and at the same time reduce the processing time of the systems for a faster identification. One of the approaches for performance optimization is to fuse two or more biometric matcher technologies to add on to the performance of the individual systems. In the present paper, we propose a new step integration based fusion method for multimodal biometric technologies, based upon eliminative machine learning. The individual matcher systems are integrated in steps eliminating unwanted user classes at each matcher step. The method achieves high accuracies and recognition rates, achieving low processing times at the same time. We compare our approach with simple sum fusion technique because of the simplicity and high accuracy rates associated with the simple sum method.",Biometrics; Face Recognition; Fingerprint Recognition; Matcher Fusion,Biometric systems; Fingerprint Recognition; Fusion techniques; Individual systems; Matcher fusion; Multi-modal biometrics; Performance optimizations; Recognition performance; Artificial intelligence; Face recognition; Biometrics,"Sharma, A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee-247667, India; email: ayushuee@iitr.ernet.in",,,,9781615677214,,,English,"Int.

Many computer aided techniques are available to assist the radiologist in taking crucial decisions. A method of microcalcification detection from digitized mammograms is presented. This method uses the LoG (Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian) filter; it is not significantly sensitive to noise. Before the application of LoG filter, the image is subjected to background subtraction which equalizes the background to some extent. LoG filter is applied with a specific standard deviation. The response of LoG filter is considered and pixel level contrast measure is used to discriminate between microcalcification and normal tissue. A description, an implementation of the proposed method is presented. This article also describes a segmentation technique that uses the fuzzy texture segmentation to provide mass detection in digitized breast images. The technique consists of two steps: first step using fuzzification with sigmoidal membership function and defuzzification and second step consists of entropic thresholding to get the segmented image.

Many real world problems involve machine leaning with missing values or attributes. Thus, learning with missing or incomplete data is an important issue for the practical implementation of pattern recognition systems. The conventional approach to this problem is to impute missing values by substituting their estimates. The proposed RFMN uses an evidence based learning approach. It extracts the underlying structure in the missing data from the available features or attributes only. The learned classes are represented by an aggregation of hyperbox fuzzy sets. A novel concept of reflex mechanism, inspired from human brain is used to handle class overlaps. The main advantage of RFMN is that it learns the data on-line and in a single pass though.

The terms associated with related concepts are grouped together to form equivalence classes by clustering the terms of the vocabulary. The query passage and the documents are represented as rough sets using these equivalence classes of terms and further partitioned into families of rough sets in higher level approximation spaces which impose partial ordering on the families of documents with reference to the query passage. Documents falling in the same family are ordered in accordance with their similarity to the query to form the relevance ranking of the documents.

A large number of design alternatives exist regarding the choice of bracing pattern and the placing of braces. In the conventional design procedure based on the principles of structural engineering, it is nearly impossible to arrive at an appropriate design of the bracing system that may lead to optimum design of the entire structure. This work proposes a novel approach in designing the steel building frames. The target is to find a cost optimal steel structure through proper placing of bracings. The proposed design scheme is developed around the modeling tool of cellular automata (CA). It offers better alternatives and an easier way to arrive at a near-optimum solution in zero time. The exhaustive experimental results point to the fact that the proposed CA based approach is most effective, while considering the design of tall building frames, and can reuse a design for scalability.

Results from GCM simulations are subjected to a number of uncertainties due to incomplete knowledge about the underlying geophysical processes of global change (GCM uncertainties) and due to uncertain future scenarios (scenario uncertainties). With a relatively small number of GCMs available and a finite number of scenarios simulated by them, uncertainties in the hydrologic impacts at a smaller spatial scale become particularly pronounced due to incomplete knowledge or information. In this study, incorporation of incomplete knowledge or partial ignorance in assessment of drought, based on GCM projections, is performed with imprecise probability, which can be defined as a probability with upper and lower bounds. Statistical downscaling based on fuzzy clustering is used to model precipitation from GCM output of Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP). Precipitation is then converted to a suitable drought index for assessing the severity. Probability density function (pdf) of the drought indicator, which is a random variable at each time step, is determined by fitting a normal distribution with interval regression, resulting in imprecise normal distribution to model the partial ignorance about future scenario and uncertainty associated with the assumption of normal distribution. Using the imprecise pdf, the imprecise probability of different categories of drought, viz., extreme, severe or mild drought is determined. The methodology is demonstrated with a case study of droughtprone Orissa meteorological subdivision, India.

In general, most of the water management problems are multi-objective in nature and often involve different types of complexities in their model formulation. Obtaining optimal solutions to such problems is always a challenging task. In multi-objective environment, in order to perceive the effect of a particular decision on the performance of individual goals, various alternatives need to be generated. For multi-objective optimization, classical methods of optimization often face difficulties in generating a sufficiently wide spread of true Pareto optimal solutions. Also it requires a large number of simulation runs to arrive at good Pareto optimal front. Recently multi-objective optimization algorithms based on evolutionary algorithms yielding attractive features to overcome those problems. In this study, an efficient multi-objective evolutionary technique namely multiobjective differential evolution algorithm (MODE) is presented for optimal control of water resource systems, with an application to a case study of reservoir operation.

Disaster assessments can be monitored using change detection and recent advances in satellite imagery, in terms of improved spatial and temporal resolutions, allow for reliable identification and prediction of change patterns. The quality of the image registration process of the involved imagery is the key factor that dictates the validity and the reliability of the change detection outcome. The fact that change detection analysis might involve multispectral, multi-source, and/or multi-resolution imagery captured at different times, calls for the development of a robust registration procedure that can handle these types of imageries. Here we use two different image registration techniques for the same set of images, which independently aid the change detection. The comparison of these two helps in verifying the detected changes. A well defined methodology is used for detecting the changes of two images once these images are properly registered and this methodology is capable of eradicating small registration errors and errors due to the radiometric differences.

An XML document is a database only in the strictest sense of the term. That it is a collection of data. As a database XML has some advantages like it is self-describing, portable & it can describe data in tree or graph structures. At the same time it is considered that XML is verbose and access to data is slow due to parsing & text conversion. Even though it is tough to provide efficient storage, indexes, security, transactions & data integrity, multi-user access, triggers, queries across multiple documents etc. with XML data repository, the application of XML in present & next generation applications and the huge amount of XML data available round the world can not be ignored. So retrieving XML data efficiently - is always a challenge. Hybrid Data Servers, SQL, XPath and WQuery have opened a new era to handle both relational and XML data. XML, has also become the standard framework for publishing on the net, as well as the standard e-commerce language to build B2B and B2C Web services. A major concern for this scenario is the ""point of creation"" bottleneck, at which creating useful, well-structured XML data can consume unduly amount of time and effort., XML helps the NLP researches, especially the ones with annotated corpus based approaches, by providing them with the knowledge representation frameworks for morphological, syntactic, semantics and/or pragmatics information structure of NL resources.

In this paper, we present a user feedback based learning algorithm for rank aggregation, which learns ranking rules using rough set theory. We present results of implementation of our algorithm to the problem of meta-searching. In training data set, we use implicit user feedback to the results of seven popular search engines for fifteen queries. We mine the ranking rules using rough set theory. We perform cross-validation test to select the best rules set. We apply the selected rules for aggregating partial lists obtained from the seven search engines in response to another set of thirty seven queries. We also discuss some metrics for rank aggregation. We compare our method with three other rank aggregation methods by using these metrics. We emphasize that main essence of our method is in modeling user's preference.

However, theoretical studies indicate that wavelets are not the ideal image descriptors; they have very crude directional representations and are not anisotropic. A recent development called the Contourlet Transform tries to overcome these shortcomings of wavelets. In this paper, we propose a multiresolution contourlet based method for face recognition. Recognition will be done in three steps. In the first step the original 8 bit image is quantized to 4 bit and 2 bit representations. In the second step, each of the 3 different resolved versions of the image are subjected to contourlet transform at five different resolutions. The approximate contourlet coefficients at each resolution represent a different feature set. In the last step these fifteen (three bit resolved version x five resolutions) sets of coefficients are then used to train separate Support Vector Machines. During testing, the results of the fifteen SVMs are fused to determine the final result.

Fifty-five experimental test results have been collected from the literature. A support vector machine (SVM) model with three different kernel functions, namely, radial basis function; polynomial function; and spline has been used for training and testing of the experimental data. A comparative study between the SVM model, neural network model and four parametric models (taken from the literature) has also been carried out. It has been demonstrated that the SVM models can predict well the nonlinear input-output relation in predicting the compressive strength of RC columns with complex input-output relation. Given the six input parameters, selected based on previous studies, SVM models outperform other existing and familiar analytical models as well as neural network predictive model. The close correlation between experimental and calculated values shows that the SVM based modeling is a practical method for predicting the confinement efficiency of RC columns with transverse steel. It can be used as a quick reference when predicting the confinement strength of RC columns by the practicing engineers because it provided instantaneous result once it is properly trained and tested.

The current research aims at proposing Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) as a novel classification technique for the determination of stability of slope. RVM is based on a Bayesian formulation of a linear model with an appropriate prior that results in a sparse representation. As a consequence, it can generalize well and provide inferences at low computational cost. It also gives probabilistic output through Bayesian inference. In this study, the input data for slope stability determination consist of values of geotechnical and geometrical input parameters. As an output, RVM predicts stability status(s). The results show that RVM approach has the potential to be a practical tool for determination of stability of slope.

In this paper we describe a platform independent and object oriented implementation (in Java) of a word alignment algorithm. This algorithm is based on the first three IBM models. This is an ongoing work in which we are trying to explore the possible enhancements to the IBM models, especially for related languages like the Indian languages. We have been able to improve the performance by introducing a similarity measure (Dice coefficient), using a list of cognates and morph analyzer. Use of information about cognates is especially relevant for Indian languages because these languages have a lot of borrowed and inherited words which are common to more than one language. For our experiments on English-Hindi word alignment, we also tried to use a bilingual dictionary to bootstrap the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. After training on 7399 sentence aligned sentences, we compared the results with GIZA++, an existing word alignment tool. The results indicate that though the performance of our word aligner is lower than that of GIZA++, it can be improved by adding some techniques like smoothing to take care of the data sparsity problem. We are also working on further improvements using morphological information and a better similarity measure etc. This word alignment tool is in the form of an API and is being developed as part of Sanchay, (a collection of tools and APIs for NLP with focus on Indian languages).

The quality of the data being analyzed is a critical factor that affects the accuracy of data mining algorithms. There are two important aspects of the data quality, one is relevance and the other is data redundancy. The inclusion of irrelevant and redundant features in the data-mining model results in poor predictions and high computational overhead. This paper focuses on a method that identifies relevant and irredundant features through correlation-based measures using novel multi thread concept which reduces the computation time for feature selection and improve the accuracy .The learning time for the feature selection algorithm in classification approach is based on the dimensionality of the data domain. Normally the learning time is very high when the data is having an increased number of attributes and instances. The multithreaded concept is used for data preprocessing and later, the data is converted into a two dimensional array of primitive types, for faster manipulation. Then the correlation measures of attributes are calculated. The proposed approach is compared with FCBF (Fast Correlation Based Feature Selection) algorithm which is implemented without using thread, and also with the built in Relief Feature selection algorithms available in Weka data mining tool. The proposed algorithm provides better accuracy and reduced time complexity for lung cancer and breast cancer data sets.

However, despite the prominent properties of SVM, they are not as favored for large-scale data mining as for pattern recognition or machine learning because the training complexity of SVM is highly dependent on the size of a data set. Many real-world data mining applications involve millions or billions of data records and hence, support vector machines may not be applied in real world data-mining scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel method for data clustering called Core Vector Clustering which is a computationally efficient realization of Support Vector Clustering. Here Support Vector Clustering problem is formulated using an approximate Minimum Enclosing Ball problem and is solved using an approximate Minimum Enclosing Ball finding algorithm.

For large input size, the running time complexity of this algorithm is very high and is measured as O (TKN), where K is the number of desired clusters, T is the number of iterations and N is the number of input patterns. It is found that T is proportional to N with larger data sets. With this approximation in consideration, the running time of κ-means tends to be quadratic, which limits its applicability for many applications. One such application is segmentation of large color images. In this paper, we present a sample-based κ-means algorithm that is applicable to large data sets. Results of experiments show that this sampling approach is much faster than the conventional κ-means algorithm. Results of color image segmentation using our approach depicts its usability.

Given an unstable video (affected by camera shake), the authors propose a method to estimate the camera shake and thus compensate for the same to stabilize the video. The camera shake is modeled as a global affine transformation between frames, containing both frame translation and rotation. This paper describes a probability distribution based technique for estimating and compensating for translations of the camera, by exploiting the quantization in motion. This technique inherently differentiates between the unwanted camera motion and the intended motion in the video. Camera rotation is estimated and compensated using a non-linear least squares fit on equations arising out of point correspondences between frames. Results of stabilization have been shown and discussed for both computer simulated and real world data sets.

PSO shares many similarities with Evolutionary Computation Techniques. PSO variants still finds difficulty to optimize the non-differentiable, nonlinear and complex multi-modal objective functions. This paper presents an improved PSO variant known as the Integrated Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (ILPSO) algorithm. The ILPSO approach captures the particles which are trapped in deep local minima, responsible for premature convergence and directs them towards optimal solution. This novel technique also introduces the updating strategy based on Hyperspherical coordinates of the particles to tackle with evenly distributed multiple minima of objective function. The proposed technique integrates Comprehensive Learning strategy to explore the solution effectively. The simulation comparisons of search efficiency, on the proposed ILPSO algorithm, are provided against different high quality PSO variants on the set of standard benchmark functions.

Despite their strengths, each filtering technique has its own weaknesses leading to hybrid filtering techniques to overcome individual weaknesses. Moreover, the aggregation used by most filtering techniques is compensatory and allows very high (pros) and very low (cons) scores to compensate each other. This is not always suitable, especially when criteria are very conflicting and / or the information about alternatives is incomplete. Another approach is to measure the pros and cons separately and then the overall statement about a given pair of alternatives is obtained by balancing the pros and cons within the set of criteria. In this paper we propose a hybrid collaborative / demographic filtering technique that implements a preference-based filtering using a fuzzy concordance / discordance principle. This hybridization helps new users and all those users who have rated less number of items to get assistance from users having close demographical attributes. The experimental results reveal that our approach outperforms the classical approach.

Finding relevant agricultural web documents related to a desired discipline is observed to be a difficult and time consuming task with available facilities. Document classification is an important technique for faster information retrieval and knowledge organization. Manual classification of web documents is tedious and sometimes practically impossible. Automatic categorization is a supervised learning task in which new documents are assigned category labels based on the training set of labeled documents. At present, no effort seems to be applied for automatic classification of agricultural documents. This paper describes an experiment for automatically classifying agricultural web documents into pre-specified categories using decision tree (DT), a machine learning classification algorithm. The DT has been observed to classify 80 to 91.6% of the documents correctly. The approach presented in this paper would be highly useful for researcher and students in faster retrieval of agricultural information available in the form of text.

Given the abundance of publicly available databases that have unresolved entities, we motivate the problem of quick and accurate resolution for answering queries over such 'unclean' databases. Since collective entity resolution approaches -where related references are resolved jointly -have been shown to be more accurate than independent attribute-based resolution, we focus on adapting collective resolution for answering queries. We propose a two-stage collective resolution strategy for processing queries. We then show how it can be performed on-the-fly by adaptively extracting and resolving those database references that are the most helpful for resolving the query. We validate our approach on two large real-world publication databases where we show the usefulness of collective resolution and at the same time demonstrate the need for adaptive strategies for query processing. We then show how the same queries can be answered in real time using our adaptive approach while preserving the gains of collective resolution.

However, all parametric contours are known to suffer from the problem of frequent bunching and spacing out of curve points locally during the curve evolution. In a spline based implementation of active contours, this leads to occasional formation of loops locally, and subsequently the curve blows up due to instabilities. It has been shown earlier that in addition to usual evolution along the normal direction, the curve should also be evolved in the tangential direction for stability purposes. In this paper, we provide a mathematical basis for selecting such a suitable tangential component for stabilisation.

Towards the goal of large scale annotation, we present an approach called ""Reverse Annotation"". Unlike traditional annotation where keywords are identified for a given image, in Reverse Annotation, the relevant images are identified for each keyword. With this seemingly simple shift in perspective, the annotation time is reduced significantly. To be able to rank relevant images, the approach is extended to Probabilistic Reverse Annotation.

In the absence of ranked features and instead of using the entire template, we propose using K partitions of the template. The approach proposed in the paper is useful for generating sequential ranks and survivor lists on partitions of template to boost confidence levels by incorporating information from partitions. The proposed algorithm iteratively generates ranks for each partition of the user template. Ranks from template partitions are consolidated to estimate the fusion rank for the classification. This paper investigates rank level fusion for palmprint biometric using two approaches: (1) fixed threshold and resulting survivor list, and (2) iterative thresholds and iteratively refined survivor list. The above approaches achieve similar performances as related manifestations of fusion architecture. The experimental results support the proposition of high in-template similarity of palmprint for a user and its relevance to the intra-modal fusion framework Experimental results using proposed approach on real palmprint data from 100 users show superior performance with recognition accuracy of 99 % as compared to recognition accuracy of 95% achieved with the conventional approach. © 2007 IEEE.",,Algorithms; Data reduction; Iterative methods; Modal analysis; Biometric recognition; Rank level fusion; Sequential ranks; Face recognition,"Bhatnagar, J.; Biometrics Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi 110 016, India; email: jbhatnagar@ee.iitd.ac.in",,,10636919,1424411807; 9781424411801,PIVRE,,English,Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-34948830639

This paper investigates a new technique to improve the performance of the system by using cohort information and user-quality as the weight in the matching. The proposed approach uses the cohort information at the decision stage as cascaded classifiers. However, the second stage is only used if the first stage classifier is uncertain of its decision. The experimental results from the decision-level classifiers combination are presented, which show that the cascaded classification system significantly outperforms the single classifier, especially at lower value of FAR which is most likely to be the operating point for any system.

However, there is no theoretical framework for choosing which features to use to model different regions of the scene background. In this paper we introduce a novel framework for feature selection for background modeling and subtraction. A boosting algorithm, namely RealBoost, is used to choose the best combination of features at each pixel. Given the probability estimates from a pool of features calculated by Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) over a certain time period, the algorithm selects the most useful ones to discriminate foreground objects from the scene background.

When the intensity space is variant due to several factors such as the camera gain or gamma correction, one needs methods that are robust to such transformations. While the most common assumption is that of a linear transformation, a more general assumption is that the change is monotonic. Therefore, methods have been developed previously that work on the rankings between different pixels as opposed to the intensities themselves. In this paper, we develop a new matching method that improves upon existing methods by using a combination of intensity and rank information. The method considers the difference in the intensities of the changed pixels in order to achieve greater robustness to Gaussian noise. Furthermore, only uncorrelated order changes are considered, which makes the method robust to changes in a single or a few pixels. These properties make the algorithm quite robust to different types of noise and other artifacts such as camera shake or image compression. Experiments illustrate the potential of the approach in several different applications such as change detection and feature matching. © 2006 IEEE.",,Camera shake; Feature matching; Linear transformation; Algorithms; Cameras; Computer vision; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image compression; Mathematical transformations; Image analysis,"Mittal, A.; Department of Computer Science and Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai- 600036, India; email: amittal@cse.iitm.ernet.in",,,10636919,0769525970; 9780769525976,PIVRE,,English,Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845584934

However, there exists significant barriers to using 3D visualization, primarily in usability and interfaces. 3D visualization is closely linked with the realization of depth or the distance between the objects along the 3 mutually perpendicular axes. Our position is that, to break through these barriers, research is needed on the following enabling technologies: a. User interfaces for 3D visualization I Depth b. 3D / Depth visualization tools for engineers c. Data navigation, data mining, and visualization of multidimensional databases, including visualization methods for categorical data. d. Computer-Conferencing using 3-D / Depth Visualization.

(M.S.), India","An X-ray/Clincal medical image generally suffers from low contrast quality and degradations which vary from one region to another. Extraction of features in medical science and image processing is a matter of study and research. X-rays contain high redundancy, as far as background information is considered and in a way govern local image statistics. Contrast enhancement techniques based on visual perception criterion [1][2], deal in use of local (3×3) edge operators for computation of local image statistics of non-filtered images for contrast modification. In context to our earlier work and findings in [3], we suggest the use of LoG filter for contrast improvement process in place of methods discussed in [1][2], An adaptive technique is suggested to improve the contrast quality of dental X-ray image using the Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian (LoG) Filter. Biologically, LoG Filter has a similar profile to the response of the receptive fields in the Human Visual System (HVS) [4]. Here, the results obtained reveal that LoG Filter is the best choice, whose standard deviation parameter sigma 'a' can be conveniently used to tune the pixel value to a maximum gray value of 255.000000 and a minimum gray value of 0.000000 in our process of contrast modification. A description, an implementation, an estimate of the contrast gain and comparison of performance of various edge detectors is presented. Implementation of LoG Filter serves to be the best choice in the process of contrast modification and achieve high contrast gain.",,Adaptive technique; Background information; Best choice; Comparison of performance; Contrast Enhancement; Dental X-ray image; Edge detectors; Edge operator; Gray value; High contrast; High redundancy; Human Visual System; Human visual systems; Local image statistics; LoG filter; Low contrast; Medical images; Medical science; Pixel values; Receptive fields; Standard deviation; Visual perception; X ray analysis; Computer vision,"Tiwari, R.B.; E and C / Electronics Engg., Shri Sant Gadge Baba College of Engg., and Tech., Bhusawal, 425 203, (M.S.), India",,,,9781932415957,,,English,"Proc.

The current work sharpens the compressed images in the Discrete Cosine Transform domain. People with reduced visual acuity have difficulties in reading small prints, or in viewing the decompressed images with blocking artifacts. Blocking artifacts represents the high frequency components of the image. High-frequency characteristics of the image are enhanced by suitably scaling each element of the encoding quantisation table. Instead of the original table, either the modified table is transmitted or the corresponding mathematical model is to be kept at the receiver. In addition to the advantages of compression, the added feature is the level of enhancement is an adjustable one at the receiver or by end user. Compression of the two-dimensional signal without much loss can be achieved with JPEG. Proposed algorithm modifies the JPEG Quantisation table so that the horizontal direction contrast is enhanced rather than the vertical direction contrast.

Towards this, we propose an unsupervised technique to generate domain models automatically from call transcriptions. We use a state of the art Automatic Speech Recognition system to transcribe the calls between agents and customers, which still results in high word error rates (40%) and show that even from these noisy transcriptions of calls we can automatically build a domain model. The domain model is comprised of primarily a topic taxonomy where every node is characterized by topic(s), typical Questions-Answers (Q&As), typical actions and call statistics. We show how such a domain model can be used for topic identification of unseen calls.

Very little work is found in the literature regarding the recognition of Gujarati script. In this paper two fairly representative sets of printed Gujarati characters and modifiers were chosen and subjected to classification by Artificial Neural Network architectures by considering linear activation functions in the output layer. The sample and test images for the Gujarati characters were obtained from the scanned images of printed Gujarati text and their features were extracted in terms of wavelet coefficients. Two Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks, one for the classification of alphabets which fall in the middle zone and the other one for classifying the modifiers which fall in the lower zone are designed. These networks achieve 94.46 % and 96.32 % of accuracy for alphabets and modifiers respectively on the test set.

A PRFHsystem takes a generalized view of inheritance by associating each class Dk in the fuzzy hierarchy with three categories of properties-public, special and private properties. The PRFH for the class Dk (1 . k . n) is defined as follows: Pk. Dk Generality [general class] Specificity [Dk1 (d1),....., Dki(di),....Dkj(dij)], Where P k is the set of preconditions= (Ppub) k.(Pspl) k .(Ppvt) k and specificity element D ki(di) means that Dki is a specific class of Dk with degree of subsumption di. A set of related PRFH is called a cluster and is represented as a PRFH-tree. The aim of this approach is to merge the newly discovered knowledge into one of the clusters of knowledge discovered in the past. The suggested growth algorithm incrementally incorporates new discovered PRFH appropriately into one of the already existing PRFH-tree by maintaining consistency as well as minimizing redundancy.

Viewing software components as web services, the current solutions to web services composition based on business web services (using WSDL, BPEL, SOAP etc.) or semantic web services (using ontologies, goal-directed reasoning etc.) are both piecemeal and insufficient for building practical applications. Inspired by the work in AI planning on decoupling causal (planning) and resource reasoning (scheduling), we introduced the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the current approaches. The solution is based on a novel two-staged composition approach that addresses the information modeling aspects of web services, provides support for contextual information while composing services, employs efficient decoupling of functional and non-functional requirements, and leads to improved scalability and failure handling. A prototype of the solution has been implemented in the Synthy service composition system and applied to a number of composition scenarios from the telecom domain. The application of planning to web services has also brought new plan and planner usability-driven research issues to the fore for AI.

We extend ideas from this work and develop an adaptive algorithm for obtaining, online, optimal control policies conditioned on a rare event. Our algorithm uses three timescales or step-size schedules. On the slowest timescale, a gradient search algorithm for policy updates that is based on one-simulation simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) type estimates is used. Deterministic perturbation sequences obtained from appropriate normalized Hadamard matrices are used here. The fast timescale recursions compute the conditional transition probabilities of an associated chain by obtaining solutions to the multiplicative Poisson equation (for a given policy estimate). Further, the risk parameter associated with the value function for a given policy estimate is updated on a timescale that lies in between the two scales above.

However many geometric problems with parametric forms require more than two observations to estimate a similarity measure, e.g. epipolar geometry. In such cases we can only define the probability of belonging to the same cluster for an n-tuple of points and not just a pair, leading to an n-dimensional probability tensor. However spectral clustering methods are not available for tensors. In this paper we present an algorithm to infer a similarity matrix by decomposing the n-dimensional probability tensor. Our method exploits the super-symmetry of the probability tensor to provide a randomised scheme that does not require the explicit computation of the probability tensor.

Recommender systems use opinions of members of a community to help individuals in that community identify information or products most likely to be interesting to them or relevant to their needs. These systems use similarity between user and recommenders or between items to form recommendation list for user. They do not take into consideration social trust network between entities in society to ensure that user can trust recommendations received from system. We have proposed a model where trust network exists between peer agents and recommendations are generated on basis of these trust relationships. The user agent seeks recommendations from trustworthy peers and produces aggregated order of recommendations taking degree of trust on recommenders into consideration. This paper also suggests a method to update trust on recommender based on importance of recommendation for user.,Degree of trust; Intentional encounters; Recommender system; Unintentional encounters,Peer agents; Recommender systems; Trust networks; Trust relationship; User agents; Artificial intelligence,"Bedi, P.; Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi, Delhi-110007, India",,,,9781932415667; 193241567X; 9781932415674,,,English,"Proc.

As a result, the users of these algorithms, who may not be search experts, spend a significant time in tuning the values of the parameters to get acceptable performance on their particular problem domains. In this paper, we present a learning-based approach for automatic tuning of search-based algorithms to help such users. The benefit of our methodology is that it handles diverse parameter types, performs effectively for a broad range of systematic as well as non-systematic search based solvers (the selected parameters could make the algorithms solve up to 100% problems while the bad parameters would lead to none being solved), incorporates user-specified performance criteria (φ) and is easy to implement. Moreover, the selected parameter will satisfy φ in the first try or the ranked candidates can be used along with φ to minimize the number of times the parameter settings need to be adjusted until a problem is solved.

However in real-world applications, synthesizing a plan is just the beginning of a complex life-cycle management process. Plans must be organized in large collections, where they can be grouped along different purposes and are amenable to the search, inspection, evaluation, and modification by human experts or automated reasoning systems. Eventually, plans will outlast their utility and be replaced. We present our solution to plan life cycle management for an autonomic computing application. We focus in particular on the automatic synthesis of plan metadata for plans containing conditional and parallel actions, well-structured loops, and non-deterministic choices. The plans are of unknown origin, i.e., their underlying action model, which could provide us with pre- and postconditions, is not available. New analysis techniques are presented that uniformly generate metadata for plans, thus allowing a system to embed plans into context and organize them in meaningfully structured plan repositories.

These variations could be used to infer solutions to unknown instances of problems based on the solutions to known instances, thus reducing the problem of learning to that of identifying the relations among problems and their solutions. We use this concept in constructing a formal framework for a learning mechanism based on the relations among data attributes. As part of the framework we provide metrics - quality and quantity - for data samples and establish a knowledge conservation theorem.

This paper presents a method for license plate extraction from car images using morphology. The algorithm uses sequence of morphological operations on the preprocessed, edge images of the vehicles. Characteristic features such as license plate width and height, character height and spacing are considered for defining structural elements for morphological operations. Connected component analysis has also been used to locate the accurate position of license plate within an image and to segment the characters available on the located license plate. The segmented characters of license plates are recognized using template matching. The experimental results with wide variety of a reasonably large set of car images are very encouraging.

Design of such an infrastructure is challenging as the global optimal solution through classical optimization techniques is, in general, next to impossible as one has to select the solution among a vast number of combinations of pipes. To solve the problem, one can model the problem as nonlinear programming problem and use any conventional search techniques such as generalized reduced gradient or using non-conventional search techniques such as genetic algorithms. The present study discusses the suitability of genetic algorithm in searching the global optimum solution for design of water distribution network. The technique is suitable as it can deal with information of market size pipes directly rather than first finding the solution in continuous domain and then rounding off the solution close to available diameters in the market or the split length solution.

A realistic off-line handwriting recognition system should take care of this common aspect. A simple but efficient approach to this problem is to subject each handwritten word to a two-class classifier in the initial stage. This classifier should take decision to pass the word to a word recognition engine in the next step or discard it as a struck-out/wrong word.

One of the most fundamental problems in software reusability is locating and retrieving software components from a large collection, which is called as repository. To reuse a software component, you first have to find it. Retrieval of components should be less time consuming and efficient. This paper addresses the issue of retrieval performance for retrieving components from a component repository. Two step process is used for retrieval of best component from repository. The initial step is Keyword based retrieval for finding all possible components according to the user requirement. This reduces the search domain, which is further refined using Soft computing technique in order to find optimal solution. Soft computing technique we have used is genetic algorithms. Weight vectors associated to attribute vectors are optimized using Genetic Algorithms for getting the best component. A Fitness function is calculated on the basis of weight vectors and attribute vectors which give us the desired result.

Therefore, a systematic framework for episodic urban air quality management (e-UAQM"") is needed to control pollution levels during adverse dispersion conditions. Mathematical modelling techniques are mostly used in predicting the air pollution dispersion phenomena. However, there exist considerable difficulties in describing pollutant dilution mechanism in urban environment due to its complexity and nonlinearity. Majority of the existing conventional models fail in accurately predicting the air pollutant concentration due to inherent limitations in form of various assumptions. In this paper, the application of conventional deterministic, stochastic, hybrid of deterministic and statistical, and artificial neural network (ANN) based line source models in the management of local air quality of Delhi city is explained. The limitations encountered in modelling of urban air pollution are also presented.

The series active power filter is used to compensate for the voltage sag, swell and voltage flicker by injecting the voltage at an optimum angle such that overall variable- amplitude (VA) loading of the UPQC is minimized and voltage at the load end is regulated. The shunt active power filter is used to compensate the reactive power and harmonics in supply current caused by the nonlinear loads. Thus, the source current is almost sinusoidal and maintains unity power factor with source voltage. A fuzzy logic based controller is developed for each of the compensator such that the voltage at load end is maintained constant, current harmonics and reactive power of source current are compensated.

The ANNs were trained using the back-propagation training algorithm on simulated data. A new approach for ANN training using back-propagation is employed that considers two different error statistics to prevent over-training or under-training of the ANNs. The preliminary results indicate that the ANNs are very efficient tools for estimating the distance of the potential pollution source from the observation well where breakthrough curve is measured.

The variations in face images due to differing expressions, pose and illumination are the key issues to be addressed by a face recognition system. In this paper a new measure, namely gray Hausdorff distance, is proposed to compare the gray images of faces directly while the existing Hausdorff distance-based measures are defined for binary images. An efficient computation of this measure in linear time is presented. The performance of this measure is evaluated on benchmark face databases for face recognition. The recognition system based on the new measure is found to be robust to considerable pose and expression variations as well as slight illumination variation.

Thus, it is important to know the spatial distribution of soil moisture. Active microwave remote sensing data are often used for soil moisture estimation beneath the ground surfaces up to 0 to 5 cm depth. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) based algorithm is implemented for soil moisture estimation from ERS 2 SAR image over bare and vegetated surfaces in a portion of Solani river catchment in India. The well known and the most widely used back- propagation neural network is used to retrieve the soil moisture. A total of seven input variables namely SAR digital number (DN) or back scatter coefficient a\ incidence angle, surface roughness, type of land cover, leaf area index, average plant height and plant water content were considered. Six different neural network architectures based upon the type and the number of input variables were designed considering DN as one of the inputs for the first three networks and a0 (instead of DN) as one of the inputs for the other three networks. Coefficient of determination (R~) and root mean square error (RMSE) between the network derived soil moisture and the observed soil moisture via in-situ measurements were used for evaluation. It was observed that for all neural networks, the architectures with <7° (instead of DN) as one of the inputs produced higher R~ 0.9)and lower RMSE. The results also indicated that fewer number of input variables were sufficient to estimate soil moisture with high accuracies. The experiments clearly demonstrated the usefulness of neural networks for soil moisture estimation from microwave remote sensing data.

Conventional rating curves, however, are not able to provide sufficiently accurate results. This study aims to investigate the potential of employing a radial basis function (RBF) type neural network for modeling stage-discharge-sediment relationships at gauging stations. The ANN approach is used to establish an integrated stage-discharge-sediment concentration relation for two sites on the Mississippi River. Based on the comparison of the results for two gauging sites, it is shown that the RBF results are much closer to the observed values than the conventional technique and multi-layer feed-forward ANN.

Each node is associated with an input and an output filter, defined by some random conditions. After applying in parallel a point mutation to all the words existing in every node, the new words which are able to pass the output filter of the respective node navigate simultaneously through the network and enter those nodes whose input filter they are able to pass. In this paper, we replace the point mutations in every node with splicing operation, which is a biologically inspired operation. Forbidding context is also added to the splicing rules, where we check for the absence of certain symbols before applying the splicing rules. The new model is called accepting hybrid networks of evolutionary processors with splicing rules and forbidding context (AHNEPSF in short). Algorithms are proposed to two much celebrated NP-complete problems, namely the 3CNF-SAT and the directed Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP). These algorithms working parallely on AHNEPSF takes linear time. All other resources (size, number of rules and symbols) are also linearly bounded by the size of the given instance of the problem. It is shown that the time for solving HPP does not depend on the number of edges of the given graph. Also, the algorithm that is given here for solving 3CNF-SAT provide all solutions, if any of the given instance of 3CNF-SAT.

Equipment lost through detonation of the landmine cannot be replaced easily, and the loss of human life is invaluable. Thus we propose a cheaper and feasible alternative in the form of Smart Dust. Smart Dust are extremely small, Micro Electronic Mechanical Systems (MEMS) engineered devices which are autonomous and can be deployed over a large area to act as remote sensors. These motes are very cheap to manufacture and replacement is easy, even with losses of a huge number of batches to adverse environmental conditions. By using infrared temperature sensors and a wireless communication protocol, we establish that these motes can detect and report the presence or absence of a landmine in a given area. This information can then be collated to map an entire area by a central computer which acts as a mobile base for the motes.

The network is capable to handle labeled and unlabeled point and granular data simultaneously. The network architecture is equipped with a Reflex mechanism similar to the human brain. It is implemented using the concept of compensatory neurons. The data clusters or classes are here represented by the aggregation of the fuzzy hyperbox sets. An important stage in the training phase is to manage the hyperbox overlaps and containments. RFMN takes the help of compensatory neurons that are trained to handle the hyperbox overlap and containment. Inclusion of these neurons with a new learning approach has improved the performance significantly for labeled as well as unlabeled data. Moreover accuracy is almost independent of the maximum hyperbox size. The advantage of RFMN is that it can learn data in a single pass (on-line) and is capable to handle input data in the form of hyperbox granules. The performance of RFMN is compared with ""General Fuzzy Min-max neural network"" proposed by Gabrys and Bargiela on several datasets.

Replacement Algorithms play a key role in determining the effectiveness of the web cache. This study exploits the abilities of Fuzzy Logic in devising a sound cache replacement policy. It deals with analysis and implementation of a Fuzzy Algorithm for cache replacement for proxy caching, wherein a set of fuzzy rules is used to decide the web pages to evict from the cache.

At the time of restoration transmission line switching is one of the major cause, which creates overvoltage. Pre-insertion resistance (PIR) is one of the methods to limit switching overvoltages and has been used for many years. Though detailed electromagnetic transient studies carried out to reach the suitable value of PIR, it can vary according to system condition and such studies are not common in a day-to-day operation of power system. This paper presents an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach to estimate the optimum value of PIR and the peak overvoltage generated by switching transients during line energization. In proposed methodology Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to train the multi-layer perceptron. The developed ANN is trained with the extensive simulated results, and tested for an equivalent 36 bus EHV system of Indian Western grid. The simulated results presented clearly show that the proposed technique can estimate the optimum value of PIR and peak values of switching overvoltages with good accuracy.

In this context, it is very important to generate various alternatives in order to perceive the effect of a particular decision on the performance of other goals. To provide better understanding of various alternatives, it is highly desirable to optimize reservoir operation problem using multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This paper aims to develop a robust operation policy by using an evolutionary algorithm based Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) technique. The solutions of multi-objective PSOs yield a trade-off curve, identifying a population of points that define optimal solutions to the problem.

Very little work is found in the literature regarding the recognition of Gujarati script. In this paper a fairly representative set of printed Gujarati numerals was chosen and subjected to classification by two Artificial Neural Network architectures. The sample and test images for the Gujarati numerals were obtained from the scanned images of printed Gujarati text and their features were extracted in terms of wavelet coefficients. Multi- Layer Perception (MLP) networks and Radial Basis Function Regularization [1] networks were used for the classification. The paper presents the details of neural network classification of these numeral images characterized by the Daubechie wavelet coefficients. A recognition rate of more than 90% is achieved by both the architectures.

However, the convergence rate of DE in optimizing a computationally expensive objective function still does not meet our requirements, and an attempt to speed up DE is considered necessary. This paper introduces a Modified Differ-ential Evolution (MDE) that enhances the convergence rate without compromising the robustness. MDE algorithm utilizes only one set of population array as against two sets in original DE at any given generation. This modification improves the convergence rate of DE and at the same time maintains the robustness. The MDE is applied to two benchmark test functions followed by non-linear chemical processes. The simulation results show empirical evidences on the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed MDE.

It requires input of four dimensionless g|roups of parameters, namely, Reynolds number. Keulegan-Carpenter number. Sediment number and Shield's parameter. Two feed-forward networks of traditional multi-layered perceptron (MLP) as well as radial basis function (RBF) are considered. The former is trained using six alternative schemes in order to impart the best possible training. The performance of various training schemes has been compared in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency. Prototype measurements reported in previous literature are used for network training. The testing results showed satisfactory performance of the proposed network. The network yielded better results than the traditional statistical regression indicating its necessity over the latter. Adoption of a different architecture than the traditional MLP did not result in gain in accuracy of the outcome: however switching across different MLP training schemes was found to pay dividends in this regard. Among the different methods of MLP training the Levenberg-Marquardt scheme yielded most satisfactory results, although its training efficiency was less than the other methods.

The concepts of intelligent traffic management system have not been successfully adopted in India. A considerable amount of traffic congestion is caused due to poor information of when and where congestion is occurring and hence the inability to avoild it. Variable message signs (VMS) is one such system, which respond dynamically to traffic congestion and can give information to commuters based on the sensor data. The core of this is the prediction of the link travel time. Coifman [1] proposed a travel time prediction algorithm for the homogeneous traffic considering the spot speed detected from the upstream of a link. In this study, heterogeneous single lane traffic apt for Indian scenario is reproduced in a traffic simulator (VISSIM) and the data generated is used to investigate the behavior of this algorithm. The algorithm is then modified to suit heterogeneous traffic WW w conditions. It was observed that although the estimates are not perfect, it is sufficient for all practical problems. Finally, the study shows how natural computing can be the solution to many traffic problems.

They are the kinds of content dependent identification methods as signature verification requires the writer to write the same text (e.g. his name). In our new method, we take the handwriting as an image containing some special texture, and writer identification is regarded as texture identification. This is a content independent for a particular script. We apply the well-established 2-D Gabor filtering technique and grey scale co-occurrence matrices to extract features of such textures and a weighted Euclidean distance classifier and K-nearest neighbor classifier to fulfill the identification task.

In this paper, we discuss an algorithm for text summarization which is independent of domain and document source. This algorithm creates text summaries by analyzing the logical struc-ture of the sentences. Sentences are parsed and important relationships are identified, stored in the form of a graph, thus graph corresponding to each sentence in the document is generated and merged to form graph of the document, now this graph is clustered into sub-graphs which represent the different topics in the document. Then a graph scoring algorithm scores the graph, and helps in extracting the important sentences towards summary. To increase the coherence of the summary, the pool of extracted sentences undergoes some transformation in a specified order, resulting in final sentences that form the summary of the document.

A search on the World Wide Web shows that in many countries, dispatchers use paper and pencil techniques to reschedule trains. At the time of writing this paper, very few countries in the world had announced development of software for rescheduling. In the present work two solutions are presented for the problem of train traffic rescheduling on a single-track railway. The first solution uses 0 - 1 Integer Programming and is an adaptation of a solution existing in the literature for the problem of Air Traffic Control. This solution takes a long time to run. So, a sub-optimal solution has been developed that uses fuzzy logic and that has a shorter running time. The parameters of the fuzzy logic controller are tuned offline so that the fuzzy logic solution is close to the 0-1 integer programming solution.

This measure is then utilized in a sliding windows algorithm to detect all possible interesting sub-sequences with respect to a reference sequence. The algorithm's effectiveness is shown to be independent of the parameter choice for the density estimates and its advantages over other prominent techniques are discussed.

An automated face recognition system requires an efficient method for detection of face region in the image sequence, extraction of facial features, and construction of a recognition model. In recent years, support vector machines (SVMs) have demonstrated excellent performance in a variety of pattern recognition problems. In this paper, we apply SVMs for face recognition (recognition model). Multi-class recognition system using SVMs are built using onc-against-the-rest approach. In this approach, one SVM model is built for each persons face (class). For each SVM model an optimal hyperplane is constructed in the kernel feature space to separate the examples of a class from the examples of all the other classes. SVMs learn the boundary regions between patterns of two classes by mapping the patterns into a higher dimensional space, and seeking a separating hyperplane, so as to maximize its distance from the closest training examples. SVM based approach for face recognition has been demonstrated for partial CMU face data base. The face recognition system is evaluated on faces of 10 different persons. For each person there arc 75 faces. The results of our studies show that, the system gives about 100% detection rate.

The perceptual difference between the two speech signals depend on their acoustic characteristics. The throat microphone speech could be enhanced to make it perceptually similar to the close-speaking microphone speech. This paper utilizes a Self-organizing map (SOM) for deriving the features of the close-speaking microphone speech from those of the throat microphone speech. Self-organizing maps create an ordered mapping of the input signals (as in the brain) into a layer of independent, interconnected units. The feature vectors of the throat microphone are clustered using the SOM algorithm. The response of the SOM to the test input pattern (derived from the throat microphone speech) is used to derive the nearest linear prediction coefficients of the close-speaking microphone speech.

This modification also finds support from neurophysiology of retina. The proposed filter can be optimized at any order of derivative in terms of the scale-ratios of the Gaussians. Such optimization yields further support to the approximation mentioned above.

To reduce the magnitude of effect of such natural calamities and for better management of water resources, it is essential to predict the rainfall, well in advance. In this study the possible relationship between the large scale climate indices like. El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). EQUitorial INdian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO) and a local climate index of Ocean-Land Temperature Contrast (OLTC) are studied and used to forecast regional monsoon rainfall of Orissa state in Lidia. To handle the highly non-linear and complex behavior of the climatic variables in forecasting the rainfall, this study employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) methodology. In this study, to optimize the ANN architecture. Genetic Optimizer is used. After identifying the lagged relationship between climate indices and monthly rainfall, the rainfall values are forecasted for summer monsoon months of June. July, August and September (JJAS) individually as well as total monsoon rainfall. The models are trained individually for monthly and for seasonal rainfall forecasting. Then the trained models are tested to evaluate the performance of the model. The results show reasonably good accuracy for monthly and seasonal rainfall forecasting. The study demonstrates the possible teleconnection between large scale climate indices and regional rainfall over Orissa and also shows the usefulness of ANNs in rainfall forecasting.

The variability of feed conditions and performance of biofilters make the application of mathematical models very useful. The lack of information on the micro kinetic and metabolic mechanisms has restricted the use of process based models. Data driven models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can predict the performance of biofilters by their ability to map the input-output relationships. This study predicts the performance of a compost based biofilter. operated continuously for 155 days with varying loading rates of benzene vapours in terms of the elimination capacity (EC) and removal efficiency (RE). Two ANN models having three layers were trained using the back propagation algorithm and by changing the network parameters. The best network architecture was selected based on low root mean square value (RMS) in the test data. The two models fitted the data well with RMS values of 0.0845 and 0.0765 for EC and 0.1183 and 0.0874 for RE respectively.

This forces the consumers to find and bind services at design time since WSDL relies on static descriptions. Also the current techniques don't address runtime service selection based on a dynamic assessment of QoS attributes. Hence in this paper, a Semantic QoS Web Services Agent Framework (SQoSWSAF) architecture has been proposed and implemented that can dynamically select a web service based on user's requirements, QoS constraints and preferences. This requires developing service and QoS ontologies and adding semantic descriptions to web services using these ontologies, which enables the automation of web services discovery, selection and composition. Dynamic service selection based on user constraints requires an agent-based system. Thus a multi-agent framework, which involves an agent querying the web service registry for the set of advertised service and selecting the best service, is implemented in the SQoSWSAF system.

In this paper, few well-known shapes from shading (SFS) techniques are implemented to extract height information from single Satellite Imagery. A comparative study about the performance of these algorithms for deriving depth information and terrain parameters has also been done. A minimization algorithm is implemented with integrability constraint, Linear Pentland algorithm with fast Fourier transform and also Tsai-Shah linear algorithm with smoothness constraint has been implemented; and these algorithms are applied to Dehradun IRS-1C panchromatic image. The results are evaluated using a reference DEM of the same area. Tsai-Shah algorithm is found to be giving good result in maximum cases. A new modified Tsai-Shah algorithm is proposed in this paper for remote sensing images, which adds smoothness constraint to remove spikes. The relative height measurements with the shape from shading techniques are calibrated into an absolute elevation model using a parametric least-squares adjustment procedure based oil a number of ground control points.

The transmission lines are exposed to faults, which are equipped with protective devices such as relays and circuit breakers. Power system disturbance are often caused by a faults on transmission lines. When a fault occurs on one of the transmission lines, the protective relays expected to detect the fault and give trip signal to circuit breaker to clear the fault. In these cases over tripping of relays can happen because of inappropriate coordination of relay settings. Due to this condition the power system margins for contingencies are decreasing. With this situation, power system protective relaying reliability be-comes increasingly important. In this paper an approach is presented using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as an artificial intelligent tool for identifying the faulted feeder that is emanating from a substation and finding the distance from the substation. Support vector Machines have well-established advantages over other methods. This approach is particularly important to avoid mal- operation of relays following a disturbance in the neighboring feeder connected to the same substation and assuring secure operation of the power systems.

Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) is therefore necessary for planning future developmental activities and implementation of disaster management programmes in mountainous terrains. A number of qualitative and quantitative methods have been used for the LHZ studies. The conventional approaches for LHZ suffer from the subjective weighting system where weights are assigned to causative factors responsible for landslide activity based on the experience of experts. In this study, an objective weighting approach based on neuro-fiizzy technique has been implemented for LHZ in a part of the Darjeeling Himalayas. This is considered to be a distribution free approach. Relevant thematic layers pertaining to the causative factors related to landslide activity have been generated using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The membership values for each category7 of the thematic layers have been determined using the cosine amplitude method (similarity method) and are used as ratings for each category of the thematic layer. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been applied to determine the weights for each causative factor represented by a thematic layer. The integration of these weights and ratings, determined through a combined neuro-fiizzy approach in GIS environment led to the generation of LHZ map of acceptable accuracy in terms of areas estimated for each landslide hazard zone.

Here, to reduce this problem of irrelevant dimensions, we consider three different projection methods viz. Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Correspondence Analysis (CA) and Multiple Discriminant Analysis (DA). To account for the possibility of pleiotropy, where the expression of certain genes may be related to more than one phenotypical condition, we use fuzzy clustering on the lower dimensional space generated by PC A, CA, and DA. To determine the optimum number of clusters, we evaluate various validity indices. In this paper, we compare these methodologies, when applied to the data generated by a genetic network simulator (expatgen) and to actual micro array data available for the yeast S. cerevisiae.

The algorithm is in the same spirit as the ant-colony optimization (ACO) algorithms, but with several significant differences. Similar to how each moving region in the ACO technique is associated with a pheromone value, the agents in our algorithm carry a luminescence quantity called luciferin along with them. Agents are thought of as glowworms that emit a light whose intensity is proportional to the associated luciferin and have a circular sensor range. The glowworms depend on a local-decision domain to compute their movements. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed glowworm based algorithm in capturing multiple optima of a series of standard multimodal test functions. The above optimization scenario can be implemented in a collection of mobile robots to address the problem of detecting multiple radiating sources (e.g., nuclear/hazardous chemical spills) spread on a two-dimensional landscape.

Only a few works in this area are found in the literature which are based on small databases col-lected in laboratory environments. Recently, a large and representative database of Bangla character images [1] has been developed. The first part of this article is devoted to shape analysis of samples of this database vis-a-vis shapes of the respective printed characters. The next part describes a two-stage scheme for recognition of handwritten Bangla alphanumeric characters. This is a 57 class problem (shapes of 3 numerals are not distinguishable from shapes of 3 basic characters among 10 numerals and 50 basic characters). In the first stage of this recognition scheme, an input character is identified in one of 11 smaller groups of characters. In the second stage, classification is performed within the particular smaller group as determined by the first stage. In both the stages of the proposed approach, local chain code histograms of character skeleton are used as the feature vector and multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the classifier.

Under the assumption of Poisson arrival statistics for targets a motion strategy is presented for each sensor such that it maximizes target detection for the next T time-steps under the constraint that motion strategies of sensors with higher priorities are fixed. This constrained optimization is resorted to avoid an exhaustive search in the joint space of all the sensors. A coordination mechanism among sensors ensures that overlapping and overlooked regions of observation among sensors are minimized. This coordination mechanism is interleaved with the motion strategy computation to reduce detections of the same target by more than one sensor for the same time-step. The coordination mechanism constrains the search by assigning priorities to the sensors and thereby arbitrating among sensory tasks. An extension of this approach to a globally optimal target detection scheme without involving the entire joint space of sensors towards the search is also presented. A comparison of this methodology with other multi target tracking schemes verifies its efficacy in maximizing detections. A tabulation of these comparisons is reported in the results section of this paper. ""Sample"" and ""time-step"" are used equivalently and interchangeably in this paper.

The model is trained with 13480 training examples and tested at 1496 independent test points. The models' performances are evaluated with wide variety of statistical parameters. The index of agreement (W?) is found to be in the range of 0.88 and 0.9883 with mean percentage absolute error (MPAE) varying between 14.7% and 46.56%, respectively. Historical concentrations of NOx, CO did not improve the models' performance much in terms of index of agreement {d2) but has shown considerable effect on mean percentage absolute error (MPAE). The historical values of ozone concentration proved to be most important input and historical values of N02 concentration proved to be the second most important input parameter in ozone forecasting.

The purpose of dynamic operator adaptation is to exploit information gained, either implicitly or explicitly. This paper presents real-coded self-adaptive GA (RAGA), which is a robust steady-state GA. It uses two multi-parent parent- centric recombination operators: multi-parent recombination operator with polynomial distribution (MPX) and multi-parent recombination operator with lognormal distribution (MLX). We introduce a mechanism of adapting operator probabilities according the landscapes of a given function. The probability of operator used for recombination operation depends upon its ability to produce good offspring. Replacement plan rewards the operator that produces a good offspring.

The cameras are uncalibrated in the sense that the correspondence between the camera fields of view are not known a priori and hence stereo-vision analysis can not be applied for extracting depth information. Moreover, the cameras make pan-tilt-zoom motion independent of each other making the task still more difficult. In our method, we first apply image mosaic technique to obtain the reference background for each camera. Next, the camera scene is registered with respect to this reference background to compensate for camera motion. During training, an individual is artificially positioned at all locations within the area of coverage and his projections onto the reference backgrounds are determined. The 3D coordinates for all the positions of the individual in real world and the corresponding 2D coordinates of the projections form the look-up-table containing artificial position data (APD). During surveillance, the 3D location of an individual is obtained by a quick check through the APD table.

Water distribution networks can fail to satisfy the intended mission due to pipe breakages.

The nature of link costs often decides the type of problem. In situations where there are variations in the level of congestion during a certain time of the day in urban road networks, it is often the case that simple shortest paths are irrelevant. Path information will be useful in situations where route guidance is needed. In this paper, stochastic and time dependent link costs are considered. It is also well established that these types of problems are computationally intractable using the traditional shortest path algorithms. Also in this paper, the application of evolutionary algorithm is explored to overcome the computational intractability in finding the paths. Implementation of the algorithm on randomly generated networks of various sizes show that computing times are a bit high for their use in route guidance. However, the real life implementation of the algorithm needs to be explored further.

More specifically, they form a data structure with an associated set of algorithms which are very useful for formal specification and verification of digital circuits and other system that can be represented as a finite state transition system. However, the size of the BDD representing these functions is highly dependent on the choice of variable ordering of the function variables, and to find a good variable ordering is an NP-Complete problem. In this paper we present a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, where we evaluate the fitness values of individuals parallely, as a possible solution towards finding good variable orderings that reduces the sizes of BDDs.

Therefore, to communicate with a deaf and dumb person, a normal human requires to have some knowledge about the sign language and should be able to make the sign language gestures. In this paper, we present a method for synthesizing hand gestures with the help of computer which may enable a normal person to convey message to a hearing impaired person more easily without any knowledge of sign language. The proposed technique requires to train the system prior to its operation. Training involves extraction of quantitative description for every sign in the dictionary from a typical gesture sequence representing the sign. The process includes hand parameter calculation for every pose in a gesture sequence which is obtained using information like position of fingers, location of metacarpophalangeal joints of fingers and the bent angles of the fingers. Once trained, the system is now ready for gesture synthesis during which a desired sign is created by animating the corresponding gesture sequence using the information obtained in training. In our experiment, we demonstrate gesture animation with hand pose exactly same as the real gesture. Thus, our proposed technique for hand gesture animation will provide a platform for interaction between normal persons and deaf and dumb persons.

A set of 64 three-tuple keywords is first generated using the four types of bases: A. T, C and G. These keywords are searched on N randomly sampled genome sequences, each of a given length (10,000 elements) and the frequency count for each of the 43=64 keywords is performed to obtain a DNA-descriptor for each sample. Principal Component analysis is then employed on the DNA-descriptors for N sampled instances. The principal component analysis yields a unique feature descriptor for identifying the species from its genome sequence. The variance of the descriptors for a given genome sequence being negligible, the proposed scheme finds extensive applications in automatic species identification. Next, a computational map is trained by the Self-Organizing Feature Map algorithm using the DNA- descriptors from different species as the training inputs. The map is shown to provide an easier technique for recognition and classification of a species based on its genomic data.

These systems use the similarity between user and recommenders or between items to form recommendation list for user without taking social trust network into consideration. We have proposed a model where a trust network exists between peer agents and recommendations are generated on basis of these trust relationships as well as similarity. The peer agents give recommendations in form of an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set, using which they can specify the extent to which they are satisfied with product, not satisfied and how much uncertainty is there in their recommendation. Then, rather than taking all the recommendations into consideration, clustering technique is used to select the representative recommendations, which reduces the number of recommendations to be processed in order to arrive at products list that may be of interest to user.

For the desisn of non linear MPC. ANN is developed by obtaining input output data from the plant model equations. For this purpose a suitable artificial neural network (ANN) architecture is selected and is trained to compute one step-ahead predictions of plant's output. Further, a linear MPC based on the transfer function of the plant is developed. This controller stabilizes the linearized plant model but is unable to control the actual plant characterized by the non linear equations.

Tata Steel being the one of the global leaders in steel making has installed world's most modern secondary steel making units. In the run of improving technology, the major threat posed, was the cost of consumables. The present project is a successful effort of reducing cost of refractory by predicting life through intelligent methods. This study is about refractory losses in RH (Ruhrstahi Heraus) vessel at Tata Steel that is one of the most important units at the steel plant. On first stage, twenty-five most relevant parameters were identified which were supposed to affect the life of refractory in the RH vessel. These parameters were continuously observed for one year and data was collected. Different types of statistical analysis were performed to find out the co-relation between the parameters and the refractory life. Finally, Artificial Neural Network and Fuzzy methods were applied. After comparing different intelligent algorithms, a Neuro-fuzzv model has been suggested. This WW J WW model has successfully predicted the life of refractor}7 in the RH vessel. This work is a unique interfacing of metallurgy and refractory7 engineering and can be helpful in improving the refractor}7 performance in the Steel and other metallurgical plants worldwide.

Since most of the VLSI layout design problems are hard optimization problems, the concept of NP-hardness for such problems is next explained along with the various algorithmic frame-works to solve them. Four selected well-known meta-heuristic strategies, namely, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search and Ant Colony Optimization are next explained, followed a comparison of these methods. Next, selected applications of these meta-heuristics to VLSI layout design are discussed. Some of their advanced variants and different hybridization techniques, adopted for superior result, are also discussed to highlight the recent research trends in meta-heuristics.

The problem of controller design has been framed as a zero-sum Markov game between the controller and the disturber (disturbances). The proposed algorithm employs an 'annealed1 combination, of a variation of the 'cautious fictitious play' approach and the 'min-max5 solution methodology, for generating an optimal policy via a simple linear program. In Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm, controller optimization is done either in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that assumes not only a stationary environment but is also inadequate for modeling noise and disturbances or the solution approach, which is computationally demanding and at times, even infeasible. The proposed approach generates a 'safe' and 'universally consistent' controller, by using a hybridization of the min-max strategy and a variation of cautious fictitious play.

A lot of scientific effort has already been dedicated in search of efficient cluster analysis methods. This paper has proposed a method to find the number of ""natural"" groups (or clusters) as well as the groups themselves. The method presented here has three parts. The first part of the method locates the high density regions of a given data set while the second part uses those high density regions ""suitably"" along with the data points of other regions to result in the clustering. The third pait of the method eliminates noise from the final clustering. Euclidean distance has been used as the similarity measure. The novelty of the method is that it finds the number of clusters automatically. Experimental results on synthetic data in R2 and R3 are provided which show the utility of this method. This method is also applicable to higher dimensional data sets. The proposed method has also found to provide good results for two real life data sets considered for experimentation.

Due to high variability of annual rainfall and conflicting demands on scarce water resources, the study and operation of reservoir systems has assumed great significance to meet the short term and long-term requirements. The reservoir managers do not find previous techniques of complex optimization models are difficult to adopt practically. New methods have to be developed which are simple to understand and can be effectively adopted for the existing systems. Any reservoir problem is usually site specific in nature and hence any general modeling methodology cannot be directly applied to study the system behavior. Artificial intelligence approaches are now being adopted to effectively simulate the reservoir system based on the experience of human knowledge and expertise. These methods are simple to understand for the reservoir managers and also may be acceptable since the model is being developed with the output and opinion of experts who are really operating the reservoir system. The Fuzzy rule based systems are very much suitable for inferring developed operating policies. In the present work a rule based fuzzy model is attempted for long-term operation a multi reservoir system. The present model was developed on monthly basis for operation and the model was demonstrated with a case of two serial reservoirs on River Godavari sub system located in South India when they are operated individually. The recent artificial intelligence tools like Genetic programming, Artificial Neural networks and Fuzzy logic are increasingly used as soft computing techniques to address modelling issues. The main advantage of these techniques lies in handling noisy data, addressing non - linear and dynamic systems. These tools also useful when it is difficult to explain the physical relationship are not fully understood in order to enhance the performance of the system. The present paper is aimed to present a fuzzy logic methodology for long-term reservoir operation. In this method a monthly fuzzy rule based model was developed based on the historical operation.

A new model namely the G-ARIMA model is presented in this paper, which involves the application of a search based multiphase genetic algorithm to the time series ARIMA model. The backbone concept of this model lies in utilizing the genetic approach effectively for implementing the Auto Regressive (AR) process, a linear stochastic model where the time series is assumed to be a linear aggregation of random shocks. The concept of genetic algorithms is used to transform an initial population of potential solutions into a population that contains solutions approximating the optimal one. A carefully chosen fitness function acts in the capacity of a yardstick to appraise the quality of each ""chromosome"" to aid the selection phase. The G-ARIMA model was tested on the IBM common stock closing prices given in Box et al using a Pentium IV processor and the residual variances obtained were found to be 20.98% lesser when compared to those of the original Box-Jenkins ARIMA approach. The low run times ensured that the G-ARIMA model could be of practical relevance too.

Human thought is inherently emotional and emotions are an essential and productive aspect of human thought and action. Emotions though supposed to be erratic from the early days, are proved to be a mechanism that encompasses readiness to act, expectations, focus to goals, appraisal - of self and others and the resulting reactions. But the question is how do we achieve the recognition of these emotions? Is it only the facial expressions, body pose, changes in metabolism etc., or something more dealing with the physical body and also the mental part of it or the cognitive states of the human mind?",,Behavioral research; Brain; Cognitive systems; Computer simulation; Metabolism; Neurology; Human emotions; Human mind; Neurotransmitters; Visual semiotics; Semiotics,"Hima Bindu, M.; Indian Inst. of Info.

Functioning of biosensor device is based on electro-chemical mechanical changes brought about by biomechanical reactions. Their applications in food processing industries are increasing day by day and there are nearly 2500 commercially available enzymes that can be used for biosensor development. Many biotechnological processes for cultivation of microorganisms require carbohydrates as an essential ingredient of the medium for fermentation where biosensors play an important role. Microprocessor based Biosensor for glucose and sucrose was developed at CFTRI Mysore, India using immobilized enzymes and an amperometric detector system. Detection of toxins and pathogens provides safety index in food processing industries, in risky areas of defense and in other polluted environments where human intervention may have to restricted. Neural networks as a tool for identifying microorganism species was evaluated. Considering the methodology of this evaluation procedure as a basis, several look-up tables of various parameters of food samples have been generated for detection of toxicity. These tables, on a concept basis, have been standardized for the purpose of correlation with the data generated by the given food sample using the microprocessor based biosensor. A correlation-based algorithm is designed for identifying the samples that belong to risk area and safety areas with respective threshold levels. The results provide better variances than the conventional methods of biosensor detection systems while micro miniaturization is possible.

This highly redundant set of observations can be efficiently averaged resulting in fast motion estimation algorithms that are globally consistent. In this paper we demonstrate this using the underlying Lie-group structure of motion representations. The Lie-algebras of the Special Orthogonal and Special Euclidean groups are used to define averages on the Lie-group which in turn gives statistically meaningful, efficient and accurate algorithms for fusing motion information. Using multiple constraints also controls the drift in the solution due to accumulating error.

Consequently, this also affects the operating quality and the economization of machines on which the bearings are used. The responsibility of bearing designers is to select an optimal scheme from all the possible alternative designs, or simply put to make the best choice. A basic requirement for conventional rolling bearings is the maximum dynamic capacity. In this paper we used Genetic Algorithm to search a design for tapered roller bearing, which has maximum dynamic capacity, and the design satisfies all the boundary conditions. The algorithm proceeds with basic objective of increase in dynamic capacity value.

Since most of the documents available on the web are machine-readable but not machine-understandable, the retrieval of relevant information continues to be a difficult task. Essentially, effective text retrieval is an issue related to an efficient text representation also. This paper presents and discusses a phrase-based model for text representation that uses rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for extracting key-phrases from the text document by a process of partial parsing. NLP technique has been used to preprocess the documents to extract the content carrying terms, and also to process a user's request to identify important search terms. Phrasal indexing aims to reduce the ambiguity inherent in words considered in isolation, and thus attempts to improve the retrieval effectiveness.

Understanding the performance of search algorithms has been one of the eminent tasks of heuristic search research. Despite the importance of graph search algorithms, the research of analyzing their performance is limited, and most work on search algorithm analysis has been focused on tree search algorithms. One of the major obstacles to analyzing graph search is that no single graph is an appropriate representative of graph search problems. In this paper, we propose one possible approach to analyzing graph search: Analyzing the performance of graph search algorithms on a representative graph of a cluster of problems. We specifically consider job-sequencing problems in which a set of Jobs must be sequenced on a machine such that a penalty function is minimized. We analyze the performance of A* graph search algorithm on an abstract model that closely represents job sequencing problems. It is an extension to a model widely used previously for analyzing tree search. One of the main results of our analysis is the existence of a gap of computational cost between two classes of job sequencing problems, one with exponential and the other with polynomial complexity. We provide experimental results showing that real job sequencing problems indeed have a huge difference on computational costs under different conditions.",,Algorithms; Computational complexity; Graph theory; Heuristic methods; Problem solving; Theorem proving; Trees (mathematics); Job-sequencing problems; Artificial intelligence,"Sen, A.K.; Indian Inst. of Management Calcutta, Joka, D.

Our scheme trains subnets for each class. Each subnet can decide whether a data point belongs to a certain class or not. Training each subnet requires data from the class which the subnet represents along with some points outside the boundary of that class. For this purpose we propose an easy but approximate method to generate points outside the boundary of a pattern class.

An alternate approach to gradient descent is the exponentiated gradient descent algorithm which minimizes the relative entropy. Exponentiated gradient descent applied to backpropagation is proposed for a multilayer feedforward neural network. The learning rules for changing weights in the output layer as well the hidden layer neurons in the network are developed. Simulations were performed to explore the convergence and learning of the backpropagation algorithm with exponentiated gradient descent. Accuracy obtained with exponentiated gradient descent back propagation was comparable to the gradient descent back propagation while convergence was faster.

It is observed that Dubois and Prade operators give highest recognition rates, as compared to other operators for Fisher Iris data. Classification performance of the Hamacher operator is better with less number of neurons for Fisher Iris data, whereas the performance with the min-max operator for Wine data is better. Timing analysis is also performed and training time is found nearly equal for all the operators.

For the solution of complex problems in pattern recognition and more generally machine intelligence, involving heterogeneous data sources of both numeric and symbolic information, the fundamental design philosophy is to employ hybrid methodologies rather than attempting to produce the solution using a single paradigm. The main objective of this paper is to integrate heterogeneous methodologies for intelligent solution of pattern recognition problems. A modular neural structure where a self-organizing Boolean neural network architecture is used as a front end processor to a feedforward neural architecture based on goal seeking principles is described. Fuzzy logic controller is included to provide decisions in uncertain conditions. The characteristics of the proposed methodology is illustrated by considering its application to a terrain image understanding system from multiple sensors and spatial databases. © 2002 Nanyang Technological University.",,Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computation theory; Fuzzy logic; Image understanding; Information science; Network architecture; Boolean neural networks; Feed-forward neural architectures; Fuzzy logic controllers; Heterogeneous data sources; Image understanding systems; Intelligent solutions; Modular architectures; Pattern recognition problems; Pattern recognition,"Mercy Shalinie, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thiagarajar College of EngineeringIndia",Fukushima K.Wang L.Rajapakse J.C.Lee S.-Y.Yao X.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9810475241; 9789810475246,,,English,ICONIP - Proc.
